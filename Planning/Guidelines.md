## How the Class Works

The FOF curriculum uses a **complementary approach** where the workbook, sermon, and teacher's lesson work together—each reinforcing the same doctrinal theme without duplicating each other.

---

## Student Responsibilities

Each week, students are expected to:

1. **Memorize Scripture of the Week**
   - Each lesson includes a key verse to commit to memory

2. **Watch the Sermon**
   - View the assigned sermon that corresponds to the week's theme

3. **Take Notes and Jot Down Questions**
   - Engage actively with the sermon content
   - Write down any questions for class discussion

4. **Complete the Homework (Before Sunday)**
   - Work through the workbook lesson during the week (fill-in-the-blank, Scripture lookups)
   - This is done over the weekend, not on Sunday morning
   - Arrive to class with answers already completed and ready to turn in

5. **Attend Class and Turn In Homework**
   - Homework will be collected and marked with correct answers
   - Participate in class discussion

## Teacher Responsibilities

Each week, the assigned teacher will:

1. **Mark Homework**
   - Review and mark the homework for the lesson you've been assigned
   - Indicate correct answers so students can learn from any mistakes

2. **Prepare Your Lesson**
   - This is **teaching**, not preaching
   - Lead the group through questions and discussion so they learn
   - Facilitate discovery rather than lecture

3. **Deliver Original Content**
   - Your lesson is **not** a duplication of:
     - The sermon they already watched
     - The workbook answers they already completed
   - Instead, your lesson should:
     - Work through Bible verses together as a group
     - Expand on the theme with fresh insights
     - Address questions students bring
     - Apply the doctrine to real life
     - Guide discussion that deepens understanding

## The Three-Part Learning Model

| Component | Purpose | Led By |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Workbook** | Personal Scripture engagement, foundational answers | Student (self-study) |
| **Sermon** | Doctrinal teaching on the theme | Video/Pastor |
| **Class Session** | Discussion, application, clarification, Q&A | Teacher |

Each component reinforces the same doctrine from a different angle—together they provide comprehensive understanding.
