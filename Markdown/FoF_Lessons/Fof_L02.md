## Lesson \#2 - How to Know the Bible

# Objectives & Preliminary Comments

**The Objectives of Lesson \#2:**

The objectives of lesson \#2 are two fold:

1\. To motivate the student to read and study the Bible.

2\. To teach the student basic Bible study skills.

You want to impart a heart motivation to read and study the Scriptures;
rather than a motivation of duty to obey the command to read the
Scriptures. In most cases the student will not be reading the Bible on a
regular basis let alone studying it. Therefore, the lesson starts with
an exhortation to read, hear, memorize and meditate on the Scriptures.

Secondly, the lesson presents the basics of Bible study: Preparation,
Observation, Interpretation and Application. If you succeed in getting
the student to start asking questions of what he/she is reading - this
is a great beginning. First, discovery questions and then thinking and
interpretive questions. Then show the student the various resources
where they can find the answers to their questions, and therefore,
laying the foundation of Bible study.

The best way to teach them how to study the Bible is to do it! Take a
passage and study it, as the example in the lesson does. If you have
those in your class who may not be believers, then it is wise to choose
a passage on “salvation” such as Roman 10:9-10.

**Exhortation to the teacher:**

Our motivation in Bible study is centered around our desire to know God
and to be pleasing to Him. Pleasing, because we desire to be set apart
unto holiness, knowing that the Word of God has the power to sanctify
us. Pleasing, because we desire to divide the Word of God rightly and
give answers to those who ask. The Holy Scriptures is the foundation of
truth that changes not only ourselves but has the power to convict and
save the lost.

And also remember the motto of Fundamentals of the Faith:

*"They will not care how much you know, until they know how much you
care."*

**As always, before entering the Classroom, always ...**

*Pray that Christ will be glorified through all that you say,
remembering that your strength*

*is supplied by God and the power of your message is the Word of God (1
Peter 4:11).*

**Parable of "The Sower"**

**Matthew 13:3-11; 18-23**

*3 "And He spoke many things to them in parables, saying, 'Behold, the
sower went out to sow;*

*4 and as he sowed, some seeds fell beside the road, and the birds came
and ate them up.*

*5 And others fell upon the rocky places, where they did not have much
soil; and immediately they sprang up, because they had no depth of
soil.*

*6 But when the sun had risen, they were scorched; and because they had
no root, they withered away.*

*7 And others fell among the thorns, and the thorns came up and choked
them out.*

*8 And others fell on the good soil, and yielded a crop, some a
hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty.*

*9 He who has ears, let him hear.'*

*10 And the disciples came and said to Him, 'Why do You speak to them in
parables?'*

*11 And He answered and said to them, '**To you it has been granted to
know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been
granted.**'"*

*18 "Hear then the parable of the sower.*

*19 When anyone hears the word of the kingdom, and does not understand
it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his
heart. This is the one on whom seed was sown beside the road.*

*20 And the one on whom seed was sown on the rocky places, this is the
man who hears the word, and immediately receives it with joy;*

*21 yet he has no firm root in himself, but is only temporary, and when
affliction or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he
falls away.*

*22 And the one on whom seed was sown among the thorns, this is the man
who hears the word, and the worry of the world, and the deceitfulness of
riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.*

*23 And the one on whom seed was sown on the good soil, this is the man
who hears the word and understands it; who indeed bears fruit, and
brings forth, some a hundredfold, some sixty, and some thirty."*
