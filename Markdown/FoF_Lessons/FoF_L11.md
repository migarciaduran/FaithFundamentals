**Lesson \#11**

**Evangelism and the Believer**


## I. INTRODUCTION


### A. Are we sharing our faith?


#### 1. Have you ever pondered the fact that


**the average person is in danger of losing his soul for eternity?**

\* Matthew 7:13-14

*13 "Enter by the narrow gate; for **the gate is wide, and the way is
broad that leads to destruction**, and _many_ are those who enter
by it.*

*14 For **the gate is small, and the way is narrow that leads to life**,
and _few_ are those who find it."*

Q. How many gates are mentioned? ... two

Q. How are they described?


Once you choose a gate, you follow a "*way*" or path (broad or narrow)

Q. Where does the broad way lead? ... to destruction (eternal hell)

**Note:** The Bible teaches the existence of an eternal hell.

(Matt. 13:41-42; 49-50; 22:13; 25:30; Luke 13:28; Rev. 20:10; 21:8)

(See appendix 1, "The Existence of Hell", for the quotation of these
verses)

Q. How many people are on the broad way? ... many

Q. Where does the narrow path lead? ... to life

Q. Who is the life? ... Christ (John 14:6)

Q. But, how many people are on the narrow way? ... few

**Point:** Just a few


#### 2. How about people you know? Which path are they on?


How about your friends?

How about your neighbors?

Whose responsibility is it to get them off the wrong path?

**3. How many Christians do you think share the gospel?** ... 5%

\* The same problem existed 2,000 years ago - Matthew 9:37

*"Then He said to His disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but **the
workers are few**."*

Q. When is the last time you & I shared our faith in Christ?

### B. It starts by having a heart for the lost


#### 1. The Lord has a heart for the lost


S It was His purpose for coming - Luke 19:10

*"For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost."*

S He wept over a city that had rejected Him - Luke 19:41

*"And when He approached, **He saw the city and wept over it**,"*


#### 2. The Lord desires all to be saved


S a. 2 Peter 3:9

*"The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is
patient toward you, **not wishing for any to perish but for all to come
to repentance**."*

b\. 1 Timothy 2:4

*"who **desires all men to be saved** and to come to the knowledge of
the truth."*


#### 3. Paul had a heart for the lost


S 2 Corinthians 12:15

*"And **I will most gladly spend and be expended for your souls**. If I
love you the more, am I to be loved the less?"*


## II. THE CALL TO WITNESS


\* **A. Commanded to preach the gospel** - Mark 16:15 (LESSON I.A, pg.

that **Christ died for our sins** according to the Scriptures,*

*4 and that **He was buried**, and that **He was raised on the third
day** according to the Scriptures,"*

\* **B. Great Commission** - Matthew 28:19-20 (LESSON I.B, pg. 67)

*19 "**_Go_ therefore and _make disciples_ of all the
nations**, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the
Holy Spirit,*

*20 teaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with
you always, even to the end of the age."*

Q. What is the central command? ... making disciples

Q. What needs to be done in order to make disciples?

S **C. The *gospel* is a sacred trust** - 1 Thessalonians 2:4

*"but just as we have been approved by God to be **entrusted with the
gospel**, _so we speak_, not as pleasing men but God, who examines
our hearts."*

Q. How did Paul view the gospel?


Q. What does entrusted mean?


Q. Therefore, what did Paul do?


**\*** **III. HINDRANCES TO OUR WITNESSING**


### A. Fear


1. Intimidation

2. Afraid of failing

3. Being called "religious"

**\_ Solution**

S The gospel comes with power - Romans 1:16 (LESSON, II.B, pg. 68)

*"For **I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is _the power of
God_** for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and
also to the Greek."*

S Pray for boldness - Acts 4:29 (LESSON, III.B.3, pg. 70)

*"And now, Lord, take note of their threats, and **grant that Thy
bond-servants may speak Thy word with all _confidence_**,"*

\* Wisdom & power comes from God - 1 Corinthians 2:3 (Paul speaking)

*3 "And I was with you in **weakness and in fear** and in much
trembling.*

*4 And my message and my preaching were **not in persuasive words of
wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power**,*

*5 that your faith should not rest on the wisdom of men, but on **the
power of God**."*

Q. What was Paul's condition?


Q. How did He describe His preaching?


Q. Who saves men? ... GOD ... you cannot

\_ **Note: _It is God's job to save a man's soul._**

Q. What is our only responsibility?

What are we commanded to do?


*"And He said to them, '**_Go_** into all the world and **preach
the gospel** to all creation.'"*

**Point:** We cannot fail, it is God's responsibility.

God will bring in the harvest.


### B. Lack of Training


1. The Lord trained His disciples

\* 2. Always be ready to give an account - 1 Peter 3:15 (memory verse)

*"but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, **always being ready to
make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope
that is in you**, yet with gentleness and reverence;"*

Q. What is the command in this verse?


Q. What must we do to be ready?

**\_ Solution**

"Know the message!"

Memorize Scripture

Practical: *Discipleship Evangelism Training*


## IV. THE MESSAGE


life**


#### 1. Blameless, above reproach

*Philippians 2:14-15 (LESSON IV.A.1,*

pg. 69)

*14 "Do all things without grumbling or disputing;*

*15 that you may prove yourselves to be **blameless and innocent**,
children of God **above reproach** in the midst of a crooked and
perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world,"*

Q. How should we appear to the world?


Q. What does above reproach mean?


\* **2. Lights of the world** - Matthew 5:14-16 (LESSON IV.A.2, pg. 69)

*14 "**You are the light of the world**. A city set on a hill cannot be
hidden.*

*15 Nor do men light a lamp, and put it under the peck-measure, but on
the lampstand; and it gives light to all who are in the house.*

*16 **Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see
your good works, and glorify your Father** who is in heaven."*

**\_ Question: Why is this so important?**

YOU NEED TO EARN THE RIGHT TO BE HEARD - your life!

Too many hypocrites in the church - common complaint against
Christianity

They will accept or reject what you say about God depending on what they
see in your life

Positive - they may come and ask!

\_ Question: _Do people you associate with know you are a Christian
???_

\_ Question: If they found out, how would your life reflect on Christ?


### B. What is the message?

*1 Corinthians 15:3-4 (LESSON II.A, pg. 68)*


*3 "For I delivered to you as of **first importance** what I also
received, that _Christ died **for our sins**_ according to the
Scriptures,*

*4 and that **_He was buried_**, and that **_He was raised on the
third day_** according to the Scriptures,"*

### C. Essentials of evangelism


**1. LESSON, section III**, pg

(Go over the verses in this section)

**2. Bridge illustration** (handout)

(Go over how to present the illustration - back of handout)


#### 3. Points that should be covered when presenting the gospel:


a\. Separation between God & man

Man's sinfulness

God's holiness & justice

b\. Man is headed for judgement - Hebrews 9:27

c\. Substitutionary death of Christ

The just for the unjust - 1 Peter 3:18

(Christ was sinless/ Christ is alive today)

d\. Good works will not help - Ephesians 2:8-9

e\. You must confess Christ as Lord - Romans 10:9

\* **The Bridge Illustration**

\_ *"For **by grace you have been saved** through faith; and that not of
yourselves, it is the **gift of God**; **not as a result of works**,
that no one should boast."* (Ephesians 2:8-9)

\_ *"that if you **confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord**, and
**believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead**, _you
shall be saved_; for with the heart man believes, resulting in
righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in
salvation."* (Romans 10:9-10)

\_ *"These things I have written to you who believe in the name of the
Son of God, in order that **_you may know_ that you have eternal
life**."* (1 John 5:13)


## V. THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN WITNESSING


\* **A. You must know the message - Christ**

Memorize key Scriptures

Memorize the Bridge illustration, or another gospel presentation

\* **B. Pray** (LESSON IV.B, pg. 70)


#### 1. Pray for the salvation of the lost


a\. Romans 10:1 (LESSON, IV.B.1, pg. 70)

*"Brethren, my heart's desire and my prayer to God for them is **for
their salvation**."*

b\. That God will open their hearts - Ephesians 1:18

*"**I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened**, so that you
may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the
glory of His inheritance in the saints,"*

Q. What did Paul pray for?


Q. Can you open someones eyes to the gospel truth? ... no, only God can

clearly**

Colossians 4:3-4 (LESSON IV.B.2, pg. 70)

*3 "praying at the same time for us as well, **that God may open up to
us a door for the word**, so that we may speak forth the mystery of
Christ, for which I have also been imprisoned;*

*4 in order **that I may make it clear in the way I ought to speak**."*

Q. What did Paul pray for?


Q. Can we open up a person's heart? ... no, only God can.


#### 3. Pray that God will give you the words to speak

*Ephesians 6:19*


*"and pray on my behalf, that **utterance may be given to me** in the
opening of my mouth, **to make known with boldness** the mystery of
_the gospel_,"*

Q. What did Paul pray for? ... for utterance and boldness from God

Q. When do we speak powerfully? ... when God guides our words

\* **C. Use the Word of God** (LESSON IV.C, pg. 70)


#### 1. The Scriptures judge the heart

*Hebrews 4:12 (LESSON IV.C.1, pg.*

70)

*"For **the word of God is living and active** and sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit,
of both joints and marrow, and **able to judge the thoughts and
intentions of the heart**."*

Q. Why use Scripture? ...it is able to judge the thoughts & intentions
of the heart


#### 2. Scriptures can lead to salvation

*2 Tim. 3:15 (LESSON IV.C.3,*

pg. 70)

*"and that from childhood you have known **the sacred writings which are
able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation** through faith
which is in Christ Jesus."*

Q. What are the Scriptures able to do? ... lead one to salvation

**Point:** Scriptures can lead someone to salvation - your wisdom cannot

\* **D. Share your testimony**

What changed after you gave your life over to follow Christ?

Testimonies are powerful

No one can argue with your testimony

Your verbal testimony is only as valid as the testimony of your life

\* **E. Evangelism includes eliciting a response - a view to
conversion**

Ask them if they want to turn from their sin and turn to Christ?

Are they willing to embrace Christ as their Lord? - Romans 10:9-10

*9 "that if you **confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord**, and believe
in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved;*

*10 for with the heart man believes, resulting in righteousness, and
with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation."*
