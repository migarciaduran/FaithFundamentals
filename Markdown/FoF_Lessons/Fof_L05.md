# Lesson \#5 - The Work of Christ

**Objective & Preliminary Comments**

**The Objective of Lesson \#5:**

The objective of lesson \#5 is five fold:

1\. To explain man’s need for a savior.

2\. To show the cost of Christ’s work.

3\. To show the provision of Christ’s work.

4\. To present the resurrected Christ.

5\. A call to repentance.

**Exhortation to the teacher:**

The lesson centers around the cost that Christ paid on the cross for our
sin. This is seen in His utter humiliation, even to the point of death
on the cross (Philippians 2:8.) Spend time looking at the crucifixion
and the events surrounding the cross; God forsaking His own son;
crushing His own son for our sin. The majesty of Christ shines in His
humility on the cross and in His victory over death.

And remember:

*"They will not care how much you know, until they know how much you
care."*

**As always, before entering the Classroom, always ...**

***Pray that Christ will be glorified through all that you say,
remembering that your strength***

***is supplied by God and the power of your message is the Word of God
(1 Peter 4:11).***

# Lesson \#5 - The Work of Christ

**Lesson Outline**

**I. INTRODUCTION**

**A. What is sin?**

**1. Sin is Lawlessness** - I John 3:4

*"Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness; and **sin is
lawlessness**."*

Q. What is lawlessness? ... breaking God's law.

**2. Sin is not doing what you know is right (Sin of Omission)** - James
4:17

*"Therefore, to **one who knows the right thing to do, and does not do
it**, to him it is sin."*

Q. How is sin defined in this verse?

... Not doing what you know to be the right thing to do

Q. What is the difference between *not doing what you know to be right*
and *not breaking God's law*?

... This is not restricted to just breaking one of God's laws.

... This could mean not following one of God's commands - such as
"reading the Bible; or sharing your faith"

**3. Sin is having immoral thoughts** - Matthew 5:28

*"but I say to you, that everyone who looks on a woman to lust for her
has **committed adultery with her already <u>in his heart</u>**."*

Q. What can we learn about sin from this verse?

... that even an unrighteous thought is sin

**4. Obscene speech is sin** - Colossians 3:8

*"But now you also, put them all aside: anger, wrath, malice, slander,
and abusive speech from your mouth."*

Q. What type of sin is being referred to here?

... your speech

|                                                                |
|:---------------------------------------------------------------|
|                                                                |

**B. Man is a slave to sin**

**1. Man has a sin nature** (Adam's sin is passed onto us) - Romans 5:12

*12 "Therefore, just as **through one man sin entered into the world**,
and death through sin, and **so death spread to all men, because all
sinned**--*

Q. What entered into the world due to Adam's disobedience? ... sin

Q. Note: not <u>sins</u> - Why is this significant?

⮚ It was the indwelling sin nature that was passed on to man.

⮚ Adam passed on his Spiritual nature just as he did his physical nature
to his offspring.

**2. Man is a slave to sin** - John 8:34 (LESSON I.B)

*"Jesus answered them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits
sin is the **slave of sin**.'*

Q. What is man a slave to? ... sin

Q. What does it mean to be a slave to sin? ... under its control

**Transition:** Recognizing man's sinful nature, let us look at God's
indictment of man's condition.

**II. MAN’S NEED FOR CHRIST’S WORK**

**A. The Condition of Man**

**1. God's indictment of man** - Romans 3:10-12 (LESSON, pg. 35, I.A)

*10 "as it is written, 'There is **none righteous**, not even one;*

*11 There is **none who understands**, There is **none who seeks for
God**;*

*12 **All have turned aside**, together they have **become useless**;
There is **none who does good**, There is not even one.'"*

Q. What are six things man is guilty of?

⮚ None righteous

⮚ None who understands

⮚ None who seeks for God

⮚ All have turned aside

⮚ They have become useless

⮚ None who does good

**a. *None righteous***

\(1\) What does *righteous* mean?

⮚ Being right before God

⮚ Being as God created man to be

Q. How many are righteous? ... none ... *<u>not even one</u>*

Q. How can Paul say *none* are righteous?

... A different standard; God's standard

\(2\) People do many things that are morally right, however,

Not even close to the standard of God - Matthew 5:48

*"Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is
**perfect**."*

Q. What is God's standard of righteousness? ... perfection

\(3\) How did Isaiah view his righteous deeds? - Isaiah 64:6

*"For all of us have become like one who is unclean, And **all our
righteous deeds are like a filthy garment**; And all of us wither like a
leaf, And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away."*

Q. How did Isaiah view man's deeds? ... filthy

\(4\) Example: Man righteousness compared to God's

⮚ A group of people were on a south sea island

⮚ They were going to jump to the U.S.

⮚ One athlete in great shape jumped 25 feet

⮚ Many jumped 10-15 feet

⮚ The ones in poor shape could barely jump 5 feet

⮚ Measured against each other their differences seemed considerable

⮚ Measured against the distance from the island to the U.S., their
efforts were equally futile.

⮚ This is how inferior man's good deeds are in comparison to God's
infinite righteousness

**b. *None who understands***

\(1\) Man has no spiritual capacity to understand or know God.

\(2\) Men are Darkened in their understanding - Ephesians 4:17,18

*17 "This I say therefore, and affirm together with the Lord, that you
walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk, in the futility of their
mind,*

*18 being **darkened in their understanding**, excluded from the life of
God, because of the ignorance that is in them, **because of the hardness
of their heart**;"*

Q. How does Paul describe man's understanding, in verse 18? ... darkened

Q. Why is their understanding darkened? .... because of their hard
hearts

**c. *None who seeks God***

\(1\) Because of their hard hearts

\(2\) Rebellious

\(3\) Man only seeks God in response to God seeking him - John 6:37

*"**No one can come to Me, unless the Father who sent Me draws him**;
and I will raise him up on the last day."*

Q. How then does man find God? ... God must draw him.

**d. *All have turned aside***

Q. What has man turned aside from? ... God

\(1\) The person who is:

⮚ Unrighteous

⮚ Ignorant of God's truth

⮚ Rebellious against God

... will live apart from God's will.

\(2\) Isaiah 53:6

*"**All of us like sheep have gone astray, Each of us has turned to his
own way**; But the Lord has caused the iniquity of us all To fall on
Him."*

Q. What does it mean to "*have gone astray*"? ... lost

Q. How many people are lost; have gone their own way?

⮚ In the early church - the gospel was called *the Way* - Acts 9:2

⮚ Christ called Himself *the Way* - John 14:6

**e. *Become useless***

Q. What does it mean to be useless?

\(1\) Worthless - Titus 1:16

*"They profess to know God, but by their deeds they deny Him, being
detestable and disobedient, and **worthless for any good deed**."*

\(2\) A person is spiritually dead; lifeless

\(3\) A dead branch, unable to produce any fruit

| ***Total Depravity*** |

**B. The Consequence of man's sin**

**1. God is your enemy** - James 4:4

**III. THE WORK OF CHRIST**

**A. The need for a sacrifice**

**1. Forgiveness requires the shedding of blood** - Hebrews 9:22

*"And according to the Law, one may almost say, all things are cleansed
with blood, and **without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness**."*

**2. God had set the requirement for the atonement of sin**

**The shedding of blood was required** - Leviticus 17:11

*"For **the life of the flesh is in the blood**, and I have given it to
you on the altar **to make atonement for your souls**; for it is the
blood by reason of the life that makes atonement."*

Would He have been treated any differently today?

**2. The burden of carrying the sin of all mankind**

**a. The agony before His crucifixion** - Luke 22:41-44

*41 "And He withdrew from them about a stone's throw, and He knelt down
and began to pray,*

*42 saying, 'Father, if Thou art willing, remove this cup from Me; yet
not My will, but Thine be done.'*

*43 Now an angel from heaven appeared to Him, strengthening Him.*

*44 And being in agony He was praying very fervently; and His sweat
became like drops of blood, falling down upon the ground."*

Q. Do you think it was easy for Christ to go to the cross?

**3. The Crucifixion**

◙ Have five different students read through the following passages.

**a. His arrest** - Matthew 26:50-54

*50 "And Jesus said to him, 'Friend, do what you have come for.' Then
they came and laid hands on Jesus and seized Him.*

*51 And behold, one of those who were with Jesus reached and drew out
his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest, and cut off his
ear.*

*52 Then Jesus said to him, 'Put your sword back into its place; for all
those who take up the sword shall perish by the sword.*

*53 Or do you think that I cannot appeal to My Father, and He will at
once put at My disposal more than twelve legions of angels?*

*54 How then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen this
way?'"*

**b. His trial** - Matthew 26:59-68

*59 "Now the chief priests and the whole Council kept trying to obtain
false testimony against Jesus, in order that they might put Him to
death;*

*60 and they did not find any, even though many false witnesses came
forward. But later on two came forward,*

*61 and said, 'This man stated, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God
and to rebuild it in three days.''*

*62 And the high priest stood up and said to Him, 'Do You make no
answer? What is it that these men are testifying against You?'*

*63 But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest said to Him, 'I adjure
You by the living God, that You tell us whether You are the Christ, the
Son of God.'*

*64 Jesus said to him, 'You have said it yourself; nevertheless I tell
you, hereafter you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of
Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.'*

*65 Then the high priest tore his robes, saying, 'He has blasphemed!
What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, you have now heard
the blasphemy;*

*66 what do you think? 'They answered and said,' He is deserving of
death!'*

*67 Then they spat in His face and beat Him with their fists; and others
slapped Him,*

*68 and said, 'Prophesy to us, You Christ; who is the one who hit
You?'"*

**c. Before Pilate** (the governor) - Matthew 27:11-26

*11 "Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor questioned
Him, saying, 'Are You the King of the Jews?' And Jesus said to him, 'It
is as you say.'*

*12 And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He
made no answer.*

*13 Then Pilate said to Him, 'Do You not hear how many things they
testify against You?'*

*14 And He did not answer him with regard to even a single charge, so
that the governor was quite amazed.*

*15 Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the
multitude any one prisoner whom they wanted.*

*16 And they were holding at that time a notorious prisoner, called
Barabbas.*

*17 When therefore they were gathered together, Pilate said to them, "
Whom do you want me to release for you? Barabbas, or Jesus who is called
Christ? "*

*18 For he knew that because of envy they had delivered Him up.*

*19 And while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him,
saying, 'Have nothing to do with that righteous Man; for last night I
suffered greatly in a dream because of Him.'*

*20 But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the multitudes to ask
for Barabbas, and to put Jesus to death.*

*21 But the governor answered and said to them, 'Which of the two do you
want me to release for you?' And they said, 'Barabbas.'*

*22 Pilate said to them, 'Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called
Christ?' They all said, 'Let Him be crucified!'*

*23 And he said, 'Why, what evil has He done?' But they kept shouting
all the more, saying, 'Let Him be crucified!'*

*24 And when Pilate saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but rather
that a riot was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of
the multitude, saying, 'I am innocent of this Man's blood; see to that
yourselves.'*

*25 And all the people answered and said, 'His blood be on us and on our
children!'*

*26 Then he released Barabbas for them; but after having Jesus scourged,
he delivered Him to be crucified."*

**d. His scourging** - Matthew 27:27-31

*27 "Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the Praetorium
and gathered the whole Roman cohort around Him.*

*28 And they stripped Him, and put a scarlet robe on Him.*

*29 And after weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and a
reed in His right hand; and they kneeled down before Him and mocked Him,
saying, 'Hail, King of the Jews!'*

*30 And they spat on Him, and took the reed and began to beat Him on the
head.*

*31 And after they had mocked Him, they took His robe off and put His
garments on Him, and led Him away to crucify Him.*

**e. His crucifixion**

*32 "And as they were coming out, they found a man of Cyrene named
Simon, whom they pressed into service to bear His cross.*

*33 And when they had come to a place called Golgotha, which means Place
of a Skull,*

*34 they gave Him wine to drink mingled with gall; and after tasting it,
He was unwilling to drink.*

*35 And when they had crucified Him, they divided up His garments among
themselves, casting lots;*

*36 and sitting down, they began to keep watch over Him there.*

*37 And they put up above His head the charge against Him which read,
'THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.'"*

**IV. THE JUDGEMENT OF GOD AT THE CROSS**

**A. The Wrath of God upon Christ**

**1. Christ forsaken by the Father** - Matthew 27:46

*"And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying,
'Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?' that is, '**My God, My God, why hast Thou
forsaken Me?**'"*

Q. What was the time? ... the ninth hour (3:00 PM)

Q. What did Jesus call out? ... *'My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken
Me?'*

Q. What title did Christ address God with? ... *God*

... This is the only time Jesus did not address God as Father.

... Why? ... We will see as we go along.

Q. What does *forsaken* mean?

... To leave behind

... To abandoned; to desert

Q. Why did the Father forsake or abandon the Son?

... Christ had become sin

◙ **Christ had taken on sin - the Father turned His back**

**⮚ Christ became sin** - 2 Corinthians 5:21

*"He **made Him** who knew no sin **to be sin** on our behalf, that we
might become the righteousness of God in Him."*

Q. During his Work on the cross, what did Christ become? ... *SIN*

**⮚ Christ bore our sin** - 1 Peter 2:24

*"and **He Himself bore our sins in His body** on the cross, that we
might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were
healed."*

◙ **Point:**

⮚ Somehow God the Father at the time Christ became sin was separated
from the Son.

⮚ God was separated from God:

**2. During the separation - The wrath of the Father falls on the
Son** - Isaiah 53:10

*"But **the Lord was pleased To crush Him**, putting Him to grief; If He
would render Himself as a guilt offering, He will see His offspring, He
will prolong His days, And the good pleasure of the Lord will prosper in
His hand."*

**Point:** God the Father crushing God the Son.

Can you imagine crushing your son.

God did it for you.

**B. God's Judgement - seen in darkness**

**1. At Christ's birth - glorious light** - Luke 2:9

*"And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and **the glory
of the Lord shone around them**; and they were terribly frightened."*

Q. Was it dark at Christ birth?

Q. What was shinning?

**2. Christ Himself was the light of men** - John 1:4,5

*4 "In Him was life, and the life was the **light of men**.*

*5 And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not
comprehend it."*

**3. At Christ's death - Supernatural darkness** - Matthew 27:45

*"Now from the sixth hour **darkness fell** upon all the land until the
ninth hour."*

Q. What time was it? ... 6th hour (noon)

Q. How long did it stay dark? ... until 9th hour (3:00PM)

Q. Why?

◙ Darkness

⮚ Babylonian Talmud meant judgement

**V. CHRIST’S DEATH**

**A. Christ's last words** - John 19:26-30

*26 "When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved
standing nearby, He said to His mother, 'Woman, behold, your son!'*

*27 Then He said to the disciple, 'Behold, your mother!' And from that
hour the disciple took her into his own household.*

*28 After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had already been
accomplished, in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, '**I
am thirsty**.'*

*29 A jar full of sour wine was standing there; so they put a sponge
full of the sour wine upon a branch of hyssop, and brought it up to His
mouth.*

*30 When Jesus therefore had received the sour wine, He said, '**It is
finished!**' And **He bowed His head, and gave up His spirit.**"*

**B. Events at His death** - Matthew 27:51-53

*51 "And behold, **the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to
bottom**, and **the earth shook**; and the rocks were split,*

*52 and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the **saints who had
fallen asleep were raised**;*

*53 and coming out of the tombs after His resurrection they entered the
holy city and appeared to many."*
