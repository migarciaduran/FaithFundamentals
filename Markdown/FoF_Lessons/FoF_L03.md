# Lesson \#3 – God: His Character & Attributes

**Objective & Preliminary Comments**

**The Objective of Lesson \#3:**

The objective of lesson \#3 can are two fold:

1\. To provide the students with a fuller understanding of God’s
attributes so they may offer Him truer and more honoring worship.

2\. To give the student a glimpse of the infinite majesty and glory of
God.

The class plan is divided into two sections:

1\. General information on the person of God.

2\. The attributes of God.

The first section presents God as one and only God, self existent and
with no beginning or and no end. It presents Him as being the God who is
revealed in creation and in the conscience of man. He is presented as
incomprehensible and yet as knowable.

The second section picks up from the first in giving the student a
picture of God through a discussion around His attributes. In this
section it is important to dwell on the application of each attribute.
Have the students share how each attribute discussed practically applies
to their daily lives.

**Exhortation to the teacher:**

True worship of God is linked to the knowledge of God. When we entertain
imperfect thoughts about God, we are robbing God of His glory and
essentially practicing idolatry.

“To glorify God is to exalt Him, to recognize Him as supremely worthy of
honor, and to acknowledge His divine attributes. Since the glory of God
is also the sum of all the attributes of His being, of all He has
revealed of Himself to man, to give God glory is to acknowledge His
glory and extol it,” John MacArthur, *The MacArthur N.T. Commentary,
Romans 1-8*, pg. 83.

**As always, before entering the Classroom, always ...**

***Pray that Christ will be glorified through all that you say,
remembering that your strength***

***is supplied by God and the power of your message is the Word of God
(1 Peter 4:11).***

**His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being
understood <u>through what has been made</u>**, so that **they are
without excuse**.*

*1:21 For even though they knew God, **they did not honor Him as God**,
