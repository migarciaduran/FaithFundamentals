***Fundamentals of the Faith***

**Lesson \#11**

**Evangelism and the Believer**

**══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════**

**I. INTRODUCTION**

**A. Are we sharing our faith?**

**1. Have you ever pondered the fact that ...**

**the average person is in danger of losing his soul for eternity?**

\* Matthew 7:13-14

*13 "Enter by the narrow gate; for **the gate is wide, and the way is
broad that leads to destruction**, and <u>many</u> are those who enter
by it.*

*14 For **the gate is small, and the way is narrow that leads to life**,
and <u>few</u> are those who find it."*

Q. How many gates are mentioned? ... two

Q. How are they described?

... 1st - wide

... 2nd - narrow & small

Once you choose a gate, you follow a "*way*" or path (broad or narrow)

Q. Where does the broad way lead? ... to destruction (eternal hell)

**Note:** The Bible teaches the existence of an eternal hell.

(Matt. 13:41-42; 49-50; 22:13; 25:30; Luke 13:28; Rev. 20:10; 21:8)

(See appendix 1, "The Existence of Hell", for the quotation of these
verses)

Q. How many people are on the broad way? ... many

Q. Where does the narrow path lead? ... to life

Q. Who is the life? ... Christ (John 14:6)

Q. But, how many people are on the narrow way? ... few

**Point:** Just a few

**2. How about people you know? Which path are they on?**

How about your friends?

How about your neighbors?

Whose responsibility is it to get them off the wrong path?

**3. How many Christians do you think share the gospel?** ... 5%

\* The same problem existed 2,000 years ago - Matthew 9:37

*"Then He said to His disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but **the
workers are few**."*

Q. When is the last time you & I shared our faith in Christ?

**\*** **III. HINDRANCES TO OUR WITNESSING**

**A. Fear**

1\. Intimidation

2\. Afraid of failing

3\. Being called "religious"

**\_ Solution**

S The gospel comes with power - Romans 1:16 (LESSON, II.B, pg. 68)

*"For **I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is <u>the power of
God</u>** for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and
also to the Greek."*

S Pray for boldness - Acts 4:29 (LESSON, III.B.3, pg. 70)

*"And now, Lord, take note of their threats, and **grant that Thy
bond-servants may speak Thy word with all <u>confidence</u>**,"*

\* Wisdom & power comes from God - 1 Corinthians 2:3 (Paul speaking)

*3 "And I was with you in **weakness and in fear** and in much
trembling.*

*4 And my message and my preaching were **not in persuasive words of
wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power**,*

*5 that your faith should not rest on the wisdom of men, but on **the
power of God**."*

Q. What was Paul's condition?

... *weakness and fear; trembling*

Q. How did He describe His preaching?

... *not in persuasive words of wisdom* (i.e. verse 5, *wisdom of men*)

... but *"of the Spirit and of Power"*

Q. Who saves men? ... GOD ... you cannot

<p>The power that is in the Gospel does not lie in the eloquence of the
preacher, otherwise men would be the converters of souls, nor does it
lie in the preacher's learning, otherwise it would consist in the wisdom
of men. We might preach until our tongues rotted, till we would exhaust
our lungs and die, but never a soul would be converted unless the Holy
Spirit be with the Word of God to give it the power to convert the
soul.</p>

\_ **Note: <u>It is God's job to save a man's soul.</u>**

Q. What is our only responsibility?

What are we commanded to do?

... go & preach the gospel - Mark 16:15 (above)

*"And He said to them, '**<u>Go</u>** into all the world and **preach
the gospel** to all creation.'"*

**Point:** We cannot fail, it is God's responsibility.

God will bring in the harvest.

**B. Lack of Training**

1\. The Lord trained His disciples

\* 2. Always be ready to give an account - 1 Peter 3:15 (memory verse)

*"but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, **always being ready to
make a defense to everyone who asks you to give an account for the hope
that is in you**, yet with gentleness and reverence;"*

Q. What is the command in this verse?

... *to be ready to make a defense*

Q. What must we do to be ready?

**\_ Solution**

"Know the message!"

Memorize Scripture

Practical: *Discipleship Evangelism Training*

**IV. THE MESSAGE**

**A. First: Get your life straight - you shine the message with your
life**

**1. Blameless, above reproach** - Philippians 2:14-15 (LESSON IV.A.1,
pg. 69)

*14 "Do all things without grumbling or disputing;*

*15 that you may prove yourselves to be **blameless and innocent**,
children of God **above reproach** in the midst of a crooked and
perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in the world,"*

Q. How should we appear to the world?

... *blameless, innocent, above reproach*

Q. What does above reproach mean?

... no one can bring an accusation against you (Titus 2:8)

\* **2. Lights of the world** - Matthew 5:14-16 (LESSON IV.A.2, pg. 69)

*14 "**You are the light of the world**. A city set on a hill cannot be
hidden.*

*15 Nor do men light a lamp, and put it under the peck-measure, but on
the lampstand; and it gives light to all who are in the house.*

*16 **Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see
your good works, and glorify your Father** who is in heaven."*

**\_ Question: Why is this so important?**

YOU NEED TO EARN THE RIGHT TO BE HEARD - your life!

Too many hypocrites in the church - common complaint against
Christianity

They will accept or reject what you say about God depending on what they
see in your life

Positive - they may come and ask!

\_ Question: <u>Do people you associate with know you are a Christian
???</u>

\_ Question: If they found out, how would your life reflect on Christ?

**V. THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN WITNESSING**

\* **A. You must know the message - Christ**

Memorize key Scriptures

Memorize the Bridge illustration, or another gospel presentation

\* **B. Pray** (LESSON IV.B, pg. 70)

**1. Pray for the salvation of the lost**

a\. Romans 10:1 (LESSON, IV.B.1, pg. 70)

*"Brethren, my heart's desire and my prayer to God for them is **for
their salvation**."*

b\. That God will open their hearts - Ephesians 1:18

*"**I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened**, so that you
may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the
glory of His inheritance in the saints,"*

Q. What did Paul pray for?

... their salvation

... that their eyes may be enlightened

Q. Can you open someones eyes to the gospel truth? ... no, only God can

**2. We should pray that God would open a door; that we might speak
clearly**

Colossians 4:3-4 (LESSON IV.B.2, pg. 70)

*3 "praying at the same time for us as well, **that God may open up to
us a door for the word**, so that we may speak forth the mystery of
Christ, for which I have also been imprisoned;*

*4 in order **that I may make it clear in the way I ought to speak**."*

Q. What did Paul pray for?

... that God would open up a door

... that he would speak clearly

Q. Can we open up a person's heart? ... no, only God can.

**3. Pray that God will give you the words to speak** - Ephesians 6:19

opening of my mouth, **to make known with boldness** the mystery of
<u>the gospel</u>,"*

Q. What did Paul pray for? ... for utterance and boldness from God

Q. When do we speak powerfully? ... when God guides our words

\* **C. Use the Word of God** (LESSON IV.C, pg. 70)

70)

*"For **the word of God is living and active** and sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit,
of both joints and marrow, and **able to judge the thoughts and
intentions of the heart**."*

Q. Why use Scripture? ...it is able to judge the thoughts & intentions
of the heart

**2. Scriptures can lead to salvation** - 2 Tim. 3:15 (LESSON IV.C.3,
pg. 70)

*"and that from childhood you have known **the sacred writings which are
able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation** through faith
which is in Christ Jesus."*

Q. What are the Scriptures able to do? ... lead one to salvation

**Point:** Scriptures can lead someone to salvation - your wisdom cannot

\* **D. Share your testimony**

What changed after you gave your life over to follow Christ?

Testimonies are powerful

No one can argue with your testimony

Your verbal testimony is only as valid as the testimony of your life

\* **E. Evangelism includes eliciting a response - a view to
conversion**

Ask them if they want to turn from their sin and turn to Christ?

Are they willing to embrace Christ as their Lord? - Romans 10:9-10

*9 "that if you **confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord**, and believe
in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved;*

*10 for with the heart man believes, resulting in righteousness, and
with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation."*

3\. Don't need to fear

Your job is to spread the message

It is God who brings about conversion

4\. You have to know the message

5\. Don't forget to pray

6\. Use Scripture - therein lies power

7\. Share your testimony

8\. Elicit a response

9\. In love

10\. The focus is Christ

**B. Ending questions**

1\. Remember the "*Wide road*" and the "*Narrow road*"

Do you know someone headed for eternal separation from God?

2\. Could you share the gospel with them ... now?

Do you know the message?

3\. Is your life in order ... shining before men as to glorify the
Father?
