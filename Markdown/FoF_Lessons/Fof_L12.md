# Lesson \#12 - Obedience

**Lesson Outline**

**I. THE MOTIVATION FOR OBEDIENCE**

**A. The Law vs. the New Covenant** - 2 Corinthians 3:5-6

*5 "Not that we are adequate in ourselves to consider anything as coming
from ourselves, but our adequacy is from God,*

*6 who also made us adequate as servants of **a new covenant**, **<u>not
of the letter</u>, <u>but of the Spirit</u>**; for the letter kills, but
the Spirit gives life."*

Points to be brought out:

**1. Our adequacy is from God - not ourselves**

Q. What word is repeated three times in these two verses? ... adequacy

Q. What is made clear about our adequacy?

... we have no adequacy within ourselves ... none!

... our adequacy only comes from God

Q. What does adequacy mean? ... acceptable; suitable

Q. What were we made adequate for? (verse 6)

... *as servants of a new covenant*

**2. We are servants of a new covenant**

**a. Not of the letter (law)** (old covenant)

Q. From verse 6, what is true about the new covenant?

... it is *not of the letter, but of the Spirit;*

Q. What is meant by *not of the letter*? ... the laws of God

Q. What is meant by "*of the spirit*"? …

**b. Of the Spirit**

**⮚ The Spirit dwells within us** - 1 Corinthians 3:16

*"Do you not know that you are a temple of God, and that **the Spirit of
God dwells in you**?"*

Q. Where does our adequacy come from?

... the indwelling Holy Spirit

**⮚ The law written in our hearts** - Hebrews 8:10

*"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel
After those days, says the Lord: **I will put My laws into their
minds**, And **I will write them upon their hearts**. And I will be
their God, And they shall be My people."*

Q. In the New Covenant where is the Law of God? ... internal

**Note:** In the Old Covenant the Law was external.

**B. If we are no longer under the Law then what about obedience?**

**1. Freed from sin and slaves to God** - Romans 6:22

*"But now having been freed from sin and **enslaved to God**, you derive
your benefit, resulting in sanctification, and the outcome, eternal
life."*

Q. We are freed from sin based on what?

... our confession of Christ as Lord - Romans 10:9

... i.e. <u>our willing submission to Christ</u> ... *enslaved to God*

Q. What is this submission based on?

... His sacrifice on our behalf

**The Result:** A love relationship between God and man - 1 John 4:19

*"We love, because He first loved us."*

**2. Love sums up our motivation to obedience**

a\. Love is obedient - 2 John 6a

*"And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments."*

b\. Love sums up our obedience - in two commands - Matthew 22:37-40

*37 "And He said to him, 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your
heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.*

*38 This is the great and foremost commandment.*

*39 The second is like it, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.*

*40 On these two commandments depend the whole Law and the Prophets.'"*

Q. What is the greatest commandment? (verse 37

Q. What is the second greatest commandment? (verse 39)

Q. What do we learn from verse 40?

... if you keep these two commandments, all of God's commandments given
in the Law and the Prophets will be fulfilled!

**C. Obedience is implied in our salvation**

1\. Love for God is a mark of true salvation - 1 John 4:8

*"The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love."*

2\. Obedience is proof of our **<u>relationship</u>** with Christ -
knowing Christ as our Lord

**⮚ Love is reflected in obedience** - 1 John 2:3-5

*3 "And by this we know that **we have come to <u>know Him</u>**, **if
we keep His commandments**.*

*4 The one who says, "I have come to know Him," and does not keep His
commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him;*

*5 but **whoever keeps His word, in him the love of God has truly been
perfected**. By this we know that we are in Him:"*

Q. Do we obey out of fear like the Old Covenant? ... no

Q. What is our motivation? (repeated twice - verses 3 & 4)

... *we have come to know Him*

**⮚ Those with saving faith will love Christ**

**Note:** <u>It is a Lordship issue</u>

See Appendix 1, "*Lordship view*"

**II. THE CALL TO OBEDIENCE**

**Again:** Obedience is proof of our relationship with Christ.

Christ is our Lord. We want it that way!

We want to obey.

That is intrinsic in salvation.

**Note:** God wants more than superficial obedience - do's and don'ts.

God wants our lives!

**A. Obedience is not a list of do's and don'ts**

⮚ Colossians 2:20-3:3 (LESSON - Box - pg. 80, top)

*20 "If you have died with Christ to the elementary principles of the
world, why, as if you were living in the world, do you submit yourself
to decrees, such as,*

*21 '**Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!**'*

*22 (which all refer to things destined to perish with the using)-- in
accordance with the commandments and teachings of men?*

*23 These are matters which have, to be sure, the **appearance of wisdom
in self-made religion and self-abasement and severe treatment of the
body, but are of no value against fleshly indulgence**.*

*1 If then you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things
above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.*

*2 Set your mind on the things above, not on the things that are on
earth.*

*3 For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God."*

⮚ Not self abasement religion

**B. He wants our hearts**

Q. What can we learn about obedience ...?

Q. What does God desire of us?

**1. The treasure of our hearts!** - Luke 6:45-46

*45 "The good man out of the **good treasure of his heart** brings forth
what is good; and the evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth
what is evil; for **his mouth speaks from that which fills his heart**.*

*46 And **why do you call Me, 'Lord, Lord,' and do not what I say?**"*

**2. A desire to serve Him** - Psalm 40:8 (LESSON, VII.A, pg. 84)

*"**I delight to do Thy will**, O my God;*

*Thy Law is within my heart."*

**3. Heart devotion** - Ephesians 6:6 (LESSON, pg. 85, VII.D)

*"... as slaves of Christ, **doing the will of God from the heart**."*

Q. What is meant by obedience from the heart?

Q. What if we fail and sin? … i.e. The struggle of obedience

**C. The struggle of obedience**

**1. We all fall short** - James 3:2

*"For **we all stumble** in many ways. If anyone does not stumble in
what he says, he is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as
well."*

**2. The example of Paul** - Paul sinned - was not always obedient ...

(Romans 7:15-19)

*15 "For that which I am doing, I do not understand; for **I am not
practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I
hate.***

*16 But if I do the very thing I do not wish to do, I agree with the
Law, confessing that it is good.*

*17 So now, no longer am I the one doing it, but sin which indwells me.*

*18 For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh; for
the wishing is present in me, but the doing of the good is not.*

*19 For the good that I wish, I do not do; but I practice the very evil
that I do not wish."*

NOTE:

⮚ Paul had a convicting heart

⮚ Paul had a struggle with sin

**D. <u>God wants our all</u>**

**Recap:** ⮚ Not do's and don'ts

⮚ God wants our hearts

**Moreover:** God wants our lives

**1. Denying oneself** - Luke 9:23 (LESSON pg. 79, I.B.1)

*"And He was saying to them all, "If anyone wishes to come after Me,
**let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow Me**."*

Question: What does it mean to deny oneself?

What does it mean to take up your cross daily?

**2. Offering oneself** - Romans 12:1 (LESSON, I.C, pg. 80)

*"I urge you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to **present
you bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God**, which is
your spiritual service of worship."*

⮚ An act of offering our lives ...

⮚ How do we become acceptable to God? ... live with your focus on
Christ!

**3. HOW TO:**

**a. Be imitators of Christ** - Ephesians 5:1-2

*1 "Therefore **be imitators of God**, as beloved children;*

*2 and **walk in love, just as Christ also loved you**, and gave Himself
up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God as a fragrant aroma."*

**b. Keep your eyes fixed on Christ** - Hebrews 12:1-2

*1 "Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding
us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance, and the sin which so easily
entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before
us,*

*2 **fixing our eyes on Jesus**, the author and perfecter of faith, who
for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and
has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."*

**c. Set your mind on things above** - Colossians 3:1-2

*1 "If then you have been raised up with Christ, **keep seeking the
things above**, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.*

*2 **Set your mind on the things above**, not on the things that are on
earth."*

**III. PRACTICAL OBEDIENCE** (a thermometer of our spiritual health)

**A. Ten commandments** - Exodus 20:3-17

**Toward God:**

1\. No other gods before Me

7\. Do not commit adultery

8\. Do not steal

**B. The law is fulfilled in the *Law of Love***

**1. Love God** - Matthew 22:37-40

37 *"And He said to him, "'**You shall love the Lord your God with all
your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.**'*

*38 This is the great and foremost commandment.*

*39 The second is like it, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.*

*40 **On these two commandments depend the whole Law and the
Prophets**."*

**2. Love is the fulfillment of the Law** - Romans 13:8-10

*8 "Owe nothing to anyone except to love one another; for **he who loves
his neighbor has fulfilled the law**.*

*9 For this, 'You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You
shall not steal, You shall not covet,' and if there is any other
commandment, it is summed up in this saying, 'You shall love your
neighbor as yourself.'"*

*10 **Love does no wrong to a neighbor**; **<u>love therefore is the
fulfillment of the law</u>**.*

**IV. APPLICATION**

**A. To disobey is inconsistent with who we are**

**Question:** Why?

1\. 2 Peter 1:4-7 (Because of what He has given us!)

*4 "For by these **He has granted to us His precious and magnificent
promises**, in order that by them you might become **partakers of the
divine nature**, have escaped the corruption that is in the world by
lust.*

*5 Now **for this very reason also, applying all diligence, in you faith
supply moral excellence**, and in your moral excellence, knowledge;*

*6 and in you knowledge, self-control, and in your self-control,
perseverance, and in your perseverance, godliness;*

*7 and in you **godliness**, brotherly kindness, and in your brotherly
kindness, **<u>love</u>.**"*

2\. We are called to be separate - holy - 1 Peter 1:15-16

*15 "but like the Holy One who called you, **be holy yourselves also in
<u>all</u> your behavior**;*

*16 because it is written, 'You shall be holy, for I am holy.'"*

Question: What is holiness?

In what are we to be holy? ... ALL behavior

I 3. We should delight to do God's will! - Psalm 40:8

*"I **delight to do Thy will**, O my God;*

*Thy law is within my heart."*

Again - our heart ...

**Appendix 1: Lordship Salvation**

**ISSUE:** Does a person have to <u>repent</u> of their sin and yield to
Christ's authority in order to be saved?

**A. Is Christ Savior only - or is He also Lord?**

**1. No lordship view:**

"Repentance is a change of mind about Christ..."

"No turning from sin is required for salvation"

(Charles Ryrie, *So Great Salvation*, pg. 96,99).

"Submission to Christ's supreme authority as Lord is not germane to the
saving transaction. Neither dedication nor *willingness* to be dedicated
to Christ are issues in salvation."

(Charles Ryrie, *So Great Salvation*, pg. 71-76).

**2. Lordship view:**

"Repentance is not just a change of *mind*; it is a change of *heart*.
Repentance in the context of the new birth means turning from sin to the
Savior."

(John MacArthur, *Faith Works*, pg. 77).

"It has often been said that repentance and faith are two sides of the
same coin. That coin is called *conversion*. Repentance turns from sin
to Christ, and faith embraces Him as the only hope of salvation and
righteousness. That is what conversion means in simple terms."

(John MacArthur, *Faith Works*, pg. 77).

"The object of faith is Christ Himself, not only a creed or a promise
(John 3:16). Faith therefore involves personal commitment to Christ (2
Cor. 5:15)."

(John MacArthur, *Faith Works*, pg. 24).

**⮚ Living for Christ** - 2 Corinthians 5:15

*"and He died for all, that they who live should **no longer live for
themselves**, **<u>but for Him</u>** who died and rose again on their
behalf."*

**⮚ Lordship is not making Jesus Lord - HE IS LORD** - Philippians 2:10

*"that **at the name of Jesus <u>every knee should bow</u>***, of those
who are in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth,"

**B**. **Example of the "parable of the two sons"**

(LESSON, pg. 84, VII.B - Matt. 21:28-32)

*28 "'But what do you think? A man had two sons, and he came to the
first and said, 'Son, go work today in the vineyard.'*

*29 And he answered and said, 'I will, sir'; and he did not go.*

*30 And he came to the second and said the same thing. But he answered
and said, 'I will not'; yet he afterward regretted it and went.*

*31 Which of the two did the will of his father?' They said, 'The
latter.' Jesus said to them, 'Truly I say to you that the tax-gatherers
and harlots will get into the kingdom of God before you.*

*32 'For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not
believe him; but the tax-gatherers and harlots did believe him; and you,
seeing this, did not even feel remorse afterward so as to believe
him.'"*
