you.'*

found favor with God.*

*31 And behold, you will conceive in your womb, and bear a son, and you
shall name Him Jesus.*

*32 He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High; and
the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David;*

*33 and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever; and His kingdom
will have no end.'*

upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and for

Q. Who was Christ's Father? ... God

Q. Who was Christ's Mother? ... Mary

Note: Christ was the God-man ... 100% God and 100% man.

Q. Why did Christ have to be God and man?

⮚ God to be the perfect sacrifice (Rom. 3:23; 1 Cor. 15:45-48)

\- We are earthy; Christ is heavenly - 1 Cor. 15:45-48

\- We are sown (created) in dishonor (sin) - 1 Cor. 15:43

\- Earthy men will sin - Rom. 3:23

⮚ A human man to die in the place of men

**B. Kenosis**

**1. Definition: emptying**

The technical term covering the humiliation of Jesus Christ in become a
man through the incarnation.

**2. Philippians 2:5-8**

*5 Have this attitude in yourselves which was also in Christ Jesus,*

*6 who, although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality
with God a thing to be grasped,*

*7 but emptied Himself, taking the form of a bond-servant, and being
made in the likeness of men.*

*8 And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself by
becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.*

**Questions:**

**Q. What was Christ's form before he became a man?** (verse 6)

He existed in the form of God

Equal with God

**Q. What form did Christ take on?** (verses 7,8)

⮚ The *"form of a bond-servant"*

A Bondservant to whom? ... To God!

⮚ Why a servants role? .... Our example (look at verse 5)

⮚ What does this mean to you personally? ... We need to practice
humility.

⮚ Likeness of man; appearance of a man

DO LESSON, Section I.C, page 30

i.e. Christ was a man.

**Q. What did Christ let go of - in becoming a man?** (verse 6)

Equality with God

Equality means "the same as"

**Q. In forfeiting His equality with God, what did Christ do?** (verse
7)

He emptied himself.

Notice: He chose to do it Himself (**self**-abnegation)

**Q. What does it mean that Christ emptied Himself?**

⮚ He set aside the exercising of His divine attributes.

⮚ Yet as we shall see He was still God.

⮚ How far did his self-abnegation go?

Note: He was still able to read man's thoughts - Matthew 9:4

*"And Jesus **knowing their thoughts** said, 'Why are you thinking evil
in your hearts?'"*

**Q. How far did His humility go?** (verse 8)

⮚ The point of death

\- Even death on a cross

\- Executed as a criminal - a disgracing death

⮚ Moreover, Christ death was <u>voluntarily</u> - John 10:17-18

*17 "For this reason the Father loves Me, because **I lay down My life**
that I may take it again.*

*18 "No one has taken it away from Me, but **I lay it down on My own
initiative**. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to
take it up again. This commandment I received from My Father."*

**3. The Humility of Jesus Christ seen in His submission to the Father**

As a bondservants role ...

This explains why we find verses like:

a\. John 5:30

*"**I can do nothing on My own initiative**. As I hear, I judge; and My
judgment is just, because **I do not seek My own will, but the will of
Him who sent Me**.”*

b\. John 4:34

*"Jesus said to them, '**My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me**,
and to accomplish His work.'"*

c\. John 14:28

*"You heard that I said to you, 'I go away, and I will come to you.' If
you loved Me, you would have rejoiced, because I go to the Father; for
**the Father is greater than I**.'"*

d\. Matthew 20:28

*"just as the **Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and
to give His life** a ransom for many."*

**C. Christ the God-man as seen in**

**The Transfiguration of Christ:** Matthew 17:1-8

1 *"And six days later Jesus took with Him Peter and James and John his
brother, and brought them up to a high mountain by themselves.*

2 *And He was transfigured before them; and **His face shone like the
sun, and His garments became as white as light**.*

3 *And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Him.*

4 *And Peter answered and said to Jesus, 'Lord, it is good for us to be
here; if You wish, I will make three tabernacles here, one for You, and
one for Moses, and one for Elijah.'*

5 *While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed
them; and behold, a **voice out of the cloud, saying, 'This is My
beloved Son, with whom I am well-pleased; listen to Him!**'*

6 *And when the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were
much afraid.*

7 *And Jesus came to them and touched them and said, 'Arise, and do not
be afraid.'*

8 *And lifting up their eyes, they saw no one, except Jesus Himself
alone."*

Q. Who was with Christ on the mountain? ... Peter, James, John

Peter refer to event as "*eyewitnesses of His majesty*", 2 Peter 1:16

Q. What was His appearance during His transfiguration? (verse 2)

... *Shone like the sun; garments white as light*
