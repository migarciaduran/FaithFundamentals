####  I. Why Pray?

READY TO FORMAT – HERE HERE HERE

Question: If God is omniscient then why pray?

**A. Introduction: Quotes on the purpose of prayer**

**1. Unknown**

"Prayer is the expression of man's dependence upon God for all things.
Prayer does not have the office of giving God information because God
foreknows all things. Rather, prayer discloses our faith in the
greatness of God and allows communion with God. Prayer brings us to our
knees before God in a humble unworthy spirit, praising Him, worshiping
Him and recognizing Him as the source of all things."

⮚ Prayer expresses our faith in God

⮚ Prayer expresses our submission to God by recognizing Him as God!

*1 "My God, my **God, why hast Thou forsaken me?*** ⮚ David is
discouraged

*Far from my deliverance are the words of my groaning.*

⮚ wonders why God

*2 O my God, I cry by day, but Thou doest not answer* does not answer

***and by night, but I have no rest.”***

And yet as the Psalm continues David, as he reflects upon God, has his
outlook changed to one of confidence and praise:

*3 **Yet Thou art holy**,* ⮚ Recognizes God

*O Thou who art enthroned upon the praises of Israel.*

*4 **In Thee our fathers trusted**;* ⮚ remembers God's

*They trusted, and Thou didst deliver them.* past faithfulness

*5 **To Thee they cried out, and were delivered**;*

***In Thee they trusted, and were not disappointed**.*

***O Thou my help**, hasten to my assistance.*

*.*

*.*

*23 You who fear the Lord, **praise Him;*** ⮚ This moves him

*All you descendants of Jacob, **glorify Him**,* to praise

*And **stand in awe of Him**, all you descendants of Israel.*

*24 **For He has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the
afflicted**;*

***Neither has He hidden His face from him**;*

***But when he cried to Him for help, He heard**.* ⮚ He knows God cares

*25 From Thee comes my praise in the great assembly;*

*I shall pay my vows before those who fear Him.*

to **pray and not to lose heart**,"*

**C. Sometimes it is different than what we ask for** - 2 Corinthians
12:7-9

*"And because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, for this
reason, to keep me from exalting myself, **there was given me a thorn in
the flesh**, a messenger of Satan to buffet me-- **to keep me from
exalting myself**!*

*8 Concerning this **I entreated the Lord three times that it might
depart from me**.*

*9 And **He has said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for power
is perfected in weakness**." Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast
about my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may dwell in me."*

Q. What was Paul asking the Lord for?

... *"a thorn in the flesh ... might depart from him"*

Q. How many times did he ask God to remove it?

Q. Why is this important?

You don't claim things from God.

**VII. How to Pray**

*"First, **I thank my God through Jesus Christ** for you all, because
your faith is being proclaimed throughout the whole world."*

Q. Who did Paul pray to?

... God

Q. Why is it most likely the Father?

... because Paul is praying *through Christ*)

**2. To the Father; through Christ; in the Power of the Spirit** -
Ephesians 2:17-18

*17 "And He came and preached peace to you who were far away, and peace
to those who were near;*

*18 for **through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the
Father**."*

Q. To whom do we have access to? (end of verse 18) ... *to the Father*

Q. Through whom is the access made possible? ... *Him* (must be Christ)

Q. How are we to pray? ... *in the Spirit*

⮚ Hebrews 10:19

*"Since therefore, brethren, we have confidence **to enter the holy
place by the blood of Jesus**,"*

**3. The Spirit intercedes for us** - Romans 8:26 (LESSON, pg. 53,
I.A.2)

*"And in the same way the Spirit also helps our weakness; for **we do
not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for
us with groanings too deep for words**;"*

**B. Christ's Teaching on How to Pray: Prelude to *The Disciple's
prayer***

1\. Matthew 6:5-6

*5 "And **when you pray**, you are not to be as the hypocrites; for they
love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners, in
order to be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in
full.*

*6 But you, when you pray, **go into your inner room**, and when you
have shut your door, <u>pray to your Father</u> who is **in secret**,
and your Father who sees in secret will repay you.*

Note the contrasts between verse 5 and 6:

Q. Who is praying in verse 5?

... Hypocrites

Q. How are they praying?

... Out in the open

Q. Who is praying in verse 6?

... you (that's us - I hope)

Q. Who are we to pray to? ... the Father

Q. What the difference in the prayers being offered in verse 6, from
those of the hypocrites of verse 6?

⮚ Praying in secret - rather than - Praying in the open

⮚ God repays in secret - They have their reward already

a\. Have you ever been in a Bible study and they have group prayer?

You know that your turn to pray will be coming up?

Did you have thoughts like:

⮚ Will my prayer be religious enough?

⮚ What will I pray for?

**Note:** Don't pray if it is not from your heart.

Our prayers are to be heard by God and not other people.

b\. From verse 6, where should we go to pray?

⮚ Inner room

\- Small room, even a storage closet

\- Prayer is communion with God

\- Just you and God

⮚ Jesus regularly went away to pray on His own - Matthew 14:23

*"And after He had sent the multitudes away, **He went up to the
mountain by Himself to pray**; and when it was evening, He was there
alone."*

2\. Matthew 6:7-8

*7 And when you are praying, **do not use meaningless repetition**, as
the Gentiles do, for they suppose that they will be heard for their many
words.*

*8 Therefore do not be like them; **for your Father knows what you need,
<u>before</u> you ask Him**.*

Q. How are we not to pray? (verse 7)

... *with meaningless repetition*

Q. What do you think is meant by "meaningless repetition" - verse 7?

⮚ Not Persistence in prayer

The elect crying out the same thing - day and night - Luke 18:7

*"Now shall not God bring about justice for His elect, **who cry to Him
day and night**, and will He delay long over them?"*

⮚ How about repeating the same prayers before a meal?

Note the omniscience of God in verse 8 - but we are still to pray!

⮚ We show our dependence upon God & agreement with God in prayer.

⮚ Somehow the Father power is released through our prayers.

**C. Christ's Teaching on How to Pray:**

**The Disciple's prayer is a model** - Matthew 6:9-13

*9 Pray, then, <u>in this way</u>: 'Our Father who art in heaven,
Hallowed be Thy name.*

*10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven.*

*11 Give us this day our daily bread.*

*12 And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.*

*13 And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For
Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.'"*

**C. The Disciples prayer is a model (continued)**

**1. The prayer in "*this way*"** - verse 9a

a\. "*pray, then in this way:*"

Q. According to the beginning of verse 9, how are we to pray?

... *in this way*

Q. What does *"in this way"* mean?

Does it say to "pray this ..."?

... Point: this is an example prayer

... It is a model prayer to structure our prayers after

Q. What was the context of the prayer?

Look at Luke 11:1, the parallel passage.

self and all its needs must be given a secondary place and the Lord
freely accorded the pre-eminence in our thoughts, desires &amp;
supplications. This petition must take the precedence for the glory of
God's great name is the ultimate end of all things. Every other request
must not only be subordinated to this one but be in harmony with and in
pursuance of it. We cannot pray aright, unless the honor of God be
dominant in our hearts."</p>
