**Lesson Outline**


## I. ORIGIN OF THE BIBLE


The purpose of this section is to explain how God revealed Himself to
man. In the discussion of Revelation, which is God disclosing Himself to
man, both Natural Revelation and Special Revelation are presented along
with the purpose of each. Natural Revelation is limited, while Special
Revelation, in particular the special revelation of the Bible is
sufficient to lead one to salvation and to adequately equip men for
every good work (2Tim. 3:15-17).

Inspiration, or the process in which God gave us the Holy Scriptures,
along with Canonicity will be discussed at the end of this lesson.


### A. Revelation


Q. What is revelation?

**1. Definition:** The act of God whereby He discloses to man what would
otherwise be unknown.


#### 2. Natural Revelation or General Revelation


**a. Creation** - Romans 1:18-20 (reveals a **mighty** God)

*18 "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in
unrighteousness,*

*19 because **that which is known about God is evident within them**;
for God made it evident to them.*

*20 For since the **creation** of the world **His invisible attributes,
His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen**, being
understood through what has been made, so that they are without
excuse."*

Q. How has God revealed Himself to man? ... through creation (vs. 20)

Q. What does creation show us about God? ... His attributes (vs. 20)

Q. What is an attribute? ... a characteristic of God; something true of
God

**Consider the endlessness of the universe** – where does it end? Here
we see the eternal attribute of God. We are finite creature bound by
time.

**Consider eternity** - God is eternal; God is outside of time.

**b. Conscience** - Romans 2:14,15 (reveals a **moral** God)

*14 "For when Gentiles who do not have the Law do instinctively the
things of the Law, these, not having the Law, are a law to themselves,*

*15 in that they show the work of **the Law written in their hearts,
their _conscience_ bearing witness**, and their thoughts
alternately accusing or else defending them,"*

Q. How has God revealed Himself to us, according to verse 15?

… Our conscience

… Man has been created as a moral creature after God’s own image.

… Man knows what is right and what is wrong … *instinctively*.

**c. Purpose of Natural Revelation**

Q. Therefore, what is the purpose of Natural Revelation?

\(1. To reveal to man that God is (Rom. 1:18-20).

\(2. To cause us to understand that God is a creator God.

Q. Does General or Natural Revelation able to lead one to salvation?

**Note:** General revelation does not give one enough information to
lead to salvation; however, the special revelation of the Bible does (2
Tim. 3:15.)


#### 3. Special Revelation


**a. Kinds of Special Revelation**

There are many types of Special Revelations, or God revealing Himself to
man. Special revelation is God revealing Himself to man by breaking into
man’s finite world.

**(1) Theophanies** (The appearances of God in tangible form)

\(a\) To Abraham - Genesis 17:1

*"Now when Abram was ninety-nine years old, **the Lord appeared to Abram
and said to him**, 'I am God Almighty; Walk before Me, and be
blameless.'"*

\(b\) To Isaac - Genesis 26:2

*"And **the Lord appeared to him and said**, 'Do not go down to Egypt;
stay in the land of which I shall tell you.'"*

\(c\) To Jacob - Genesis 32:30

*"So Jacob named the place Peniel, for he said, '**I have seen God face
to face**, yet my life has been preserved.'"*

\(d\) To Moses - Exodus 3:2-6

*2 "And the **angel of the Lord appeared to him** in a blazing fire from
the midst of a bush; and he looked, and behold, the bush was burning
with fire, yet the bush was not consumed."*

**(2) Dreams and Visions**

\(a\) Jacob's Ladder:

A dream - The blessing passed on to Jacob - Genesis 28:12-16

\(b\) Solomon's wisdom - 1 Kings 3:5-15

*5 "In Gibeon **the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream at night**; and
God said, 'Ask what you wish me to give you.'"*

\(c\) Daniel's revealing of Nebuchadnezzar's dream - Daniel 2:19,28

**(3) Miracles and signs**

Q. How about miracles & signs?

What were some of the miracles God did, recorded in the O.T.?

\(a\) The Flood - Genesis 7

\(b\) The destruction of Sodom and Gemora - Genesis 19

\(c\) The burning bush - Exodus 3

\(d\) The plagues of Egypt - Exodus 7-13

\(e\) The parting of the Red Sea - Exodus 14

**(4) The Prophets**

Note: A prophet is one who speaks forth God's word. This may or may not
be foretelling the future.

Q. Who was the greatest of all prophets? ... Jesus Christ

**(5) Jesus Christ** ... The greatest special revelation of all History.

**(6) The Scriptures** This will be our focus in this lesson

**b. The Sufficiency of special revelation**

**(1) Gives a limited knowledge of God**

\(a\) Deuteronomy 29:29

*"**The secret things belong to the Lord our God**, but **the things
revealed belong to us** and to our sons forever, that we may observe all
the words of this law."*

Q. Do we know everything?

Q. How much do we know?

\(b\) Romans 11:33

*"Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!
**How unsearchable are His judgments and unfathomable His ways**!"*

**(2) Yet Scripture is adequate:**

\(a\) To lead to salvation - 2 Timothy 3:15

*"and that from childhood you have known **the sacred writings which are
able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation** through faith
which is in Christ Jesus."*

Q. What is Scripture able to do? ... Lead one to salvation!

\(b\) For the equipping of the saints - 2 Timothy 3:16,17

*16 "**All Scripture** is inspired by God and profitable for teaching,
for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness;*

*17 that the man of God may be **adequate, equipped** for every good
work."*

divide the lamb.*

is left of it until morning, you shall burn with fire.*

*11 'Now you shall eat it in this manner: with your loins girded, your
sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and you shall eat it
in haste-- it is the Lord's Passover.*

*12 '**For I will go through the land of Egypt on that night, and will
strike down all the first-born in the land of Egypt**, both man and
beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments-- I am
the Lord.*

*13 'And **the blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you
live; and when I see the blood I will pass over you**, and no plague

never let us be tempted beyond what we are able to endure.


#### 1. God does not temp anyone

*James 1:13*


*“Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am being tempted by God"; for
God cannot be tempted by evil, and He Himself does not tempt anyone.”*

endure** – I Cor. 10:13

*“No temptation has overtaken you but such as is common to man; and God
is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are
able, but with the temptation will provide the way of escape also, that
you may be able to endure it.”*

**_4._ _PROPHETICAL BOOKS_** - 17 books

Q. Why are the prophets divided into the *Major Prophets* and *Minor
Prophets?*

Answer: The length of the books – the minor are shorter!

Q. How do you think the prophets (the writers) were received by the
Jewish people?

⮚ **They were persecuted** - Acts 7:52

*"**Which one of the prophets did your fathers not persecute?** And they
killed those who had previously announced the coming of the Righteous
One, whose betrayers and murderers you have now become;*

⮚ **They killed them** - Parable of the vineyard - Luke 20:9-16

*9 "And He began to tell the people this parable: "A man planted a
vineyard and rented it out to vine-growers, and went on a journey for a
long time.*

*10 "And at the harvest time he sent a slave to the vine-growers, in
order that they might give him some of the produce of the vineyard; but
the vine-growers **beat him** and sent him away empty-handed.*

*11 "And he proceeded to send another slave; and they **beat him also**
and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty-handed.*

*12 "And he proceeded to send a third; and this one also they wounded
and cast out.*

*13 "And the owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? **I will send
my beloved son**; perhaps they will respect him.'*

*14 "But when the vine-growers saw him, they reasoned with one another,
saying, 'This is the heir; let us **kill him** that the inheritance may
be ours.'*

*15 "And they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What,
therefore, will the owner of the vineyard do to them?*

*16 "He will come and destroy these vine-growers and will give the
vineyard to others." And when they heard it, they said, "May it never
be!"*

\(b\) Matthew, Mark & Luke

**3. Supplemental Gospel:** John


#### 4. Brief overview of each Gospel


**a. MATTHEW**

**(1) Author:** Tax collector; Apostle of Christ (AD 60)

**(2) Presents Christ as _King_**

\(a\) Genealogy of Christ

⮚ From Abraham to Christ – tracing the line of Joseph

⮚ Establishes Christ's royal claim to the throne by showing His legal
descent from David through Joseph.

Note: Luke 3:23-38 gives the genealogy from Adam to Christ – tracing the
line of Mary and demonstrating the blood right of Christ, through David,
to the throne.

⮚ The Virgin birth was a requirement:

\- Jeconiah (also called Jehoiachin or Coniah) was in the linage of
Christ, through Joseph.

\- Jeremiah 22:30 - Coniah was cursed - no descendent would be king

\- Therefore, if Christ was of the blood line of Joseph, Christ would be
under the curse of Coniah and not able to assume the throne. However,
Christ was not born of Joseph, but of the Holy Spirit.

⮚ Christ carried royal blood through Mary, and was in the line of David
through both Joseph and Mary. But Christ did not carry a blood line
through Joseph, due to the virgin birth.

\(b\) Peter's statement of Christ's deity - Matthew 16:16

*"And Simon Peter answered and said, '**Thou art the Christ, the Son of
the living God**.'"*

\(c\) Behold your King - Matthew 21:5

*"Say to the daughter of Zion, '**Behold your King** is coming to you,
Gentle, and mounted on a donkey, Even on a colt, the foal of a beast of
burden.'"*

**b. MARK**

**(1) Author:** Foreign missionary; disciple of Peter (AD 50)

**(2) Presents Christ as _servant_**

\(a\) Christ came to serve - Mark 10:43-45

*43 "But it is not so among you, but whoever wishes to become great
among you shall be your servant;*

*44 and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be slave of all.*

*45 For even **the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve,
and to give His life a ransom for many.**"*

\(b\) Take up your cross - Mark 8:34-37

*34 **And He summoned the multitude with His disciples, and said to
them, ‘If anyone wishes to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take
up his cross, and follow Me**.*

*35 For whoever wishes to save his life shall lose it; but whoever loses
his life for My sake and the gospel's shall save it.*

*36 For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world, and forfeit
his soul?*

*37 For what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?'"*

people for God's own possession**, that you may proclaim the
excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His
marvelous light;*

## VII. THE INSPIRATION OF THE BIBLE


### A. Introduction


1. We talked about Revelation:

⮚ Natural revelation

⮚ Special revelation

**Definition:** The act of God whereby He discloses to man what would
otherwise be unknown.

2. Now we want to talk about **_Inspiration_**.

**Definition:** Inspiration involves God overseeing and directing men to
write His words. It is a process by which God, as the instigator, worked
through human prophets without destroying their individual personalities
and styles, to produce divinely authoritative writings.

**Note:** We will see that the Biblical word for inspiration
“Theopnestos” actually means *God breathed*. It is God breathing out His
word.

3. Note: Revelation is God revealing Himself to us.

Inspiration is how He did it!

**Questions:**

⮚ Is the Bible God's word?

⮚ How do you know?

⮚ Concepts people have of the Bible:

\- Full of errors

\- Lot of good teaching

\- Don't really know

\- Meaning lost over time

What is your concept of the Bible?

Q. Do you believe the Bible is the Inspired word of God?

It is important to understand from the outset that God has revealed His
word to us. We have accepted it as His inspired word because of the
transformation that it has caused in our lives; the conviction that it
has on our souls; and the revelation that it gives of His majesty.
Moreover, because of this belief, that it is truth, we accept the fact
that it is His inspired word since it states that it is.

The fact that the 39 books of the O.T., as we have it today, was
accepted by the early Jewish people and by Christ is clear. The fact
that it is referred to as the inspired word of God by the N.T. and by
Christ is clear. The fact that it states that it is “God’s word” over
2000 times is clear. The fact that it has God’s mark of inspiration on
it is seen by its prophetic power.

The N.T. can be shown to have been accepted by the church without
dispute since the early church councils. It came with power, due to the
miracles that set the Apostles apart from others during this time period
(2Cor. 12:12). Moreover, Paul’s writing were considered equal with the
O.T. Scriptures (2Peter 3:15-16.) It was accepted by the early church
because it came with the life changing evidence of the Gospel (1Thess.
2:13).

We cannot prove what books of the N.T. are cononical. However, we know
that they would have to be consistent with the rest of Scripture, since
all Scripture is true based on the integrity of God. We also know that
there were writings yet to come do to the John 16:13 and 2Peter 3:15-16
passages. We also know that since God’s has inspired the O.T. Scriptures
and that more were to come that He, in His sovereignty would guide men
to discover His revelation. Obviously, the God of the O.T. has such
power.

Moreover, God is protective of His word. Both the O.T. and the N.T.
attest to this:

*“Do not add to His words Lest He reprove you, and you be proved a
liar.”,* Proverbs 30:6

*“ testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book:
if anyone adds to them, God shall add to him the plagues which are
written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the
book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of
life and from the holy city, which are written in this book.”*,
Revelation 22:18-19.

God does not want anyone taking away or adding to His Word. The fact
that Revelation was the last book written and that it puts closure by
tying to the events in Genesis (i.e. In Genesis is the creation; In
Revelation is the destruction of the world and the recreation of the New
World; In Genesis is the fall of man; In Revelation is the resurrection
of man back into the presence of God.) Moreover, the prophesies of the
return of Christ and the events of the end times, leads one to believe
that Rev. 22:18-19 is the end of the Canon.


### B. Divine sovereignty


**First and always:**

Remember that God is in control of all things. Only God could break into
our finite world, we could never break into His. He chose to reveal
Himself through the various Special Revelations, covered in section I,
above. He chose to give us His word in the writings of the Bible.
Moreover, He promises that His word will be preserved – for all time.


#### 1. God is in total control of all things

*Isaiah 46:10*


*“Declaring the end from the beginning And from ancient times things
which have not been done, Saying,' **My purpose will be established, And
I will accomplish all My good pleasure**';”*


#### 2. God will preserve His word

*Isa. 40:8; Mat. 5:18; 1Pet 1:25*


a\. Isaiah 40:8

*The grass withers, the flower fades, But **the word of our God stands
forever**.*

b\. Matthew 5:18

*"For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not **the
smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law**, until all is
accomplished.*

c\. 1 Peter 1:25

> ***But the word of the Lord abides forever**. "And this is the word
> which was preached to you.*

|  |
|:--:|
| **Important** |
| Man does not determine what Books are God's word. Man just discovers what God has already accomplished in revealing His word to man. |


### C. Witness of the Holy Spirit


Moreover, we believe the Bible is the inspired Word of God because the
Holy Spirit has used it to convict us, save us and teach us. We have
also witnessed this in the lives of others.

1. **The Word of God is able to lead one to salvation** – the Gospel,
as presented in the Bible, says it will change lives – and people give
testimony to this truth.

2 Timothy 3:15

*"and that from childhood you have known **the sacred writings which are
able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation** through faith
which is in Christ Jesus."*

2. **Convicts and judges our thoughts & heart** – Hebrews 4:12

*"For **the word of God** is **living and active** and sharper than any
two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit,
of both joints and marrow, and **able to judge the thoughts and
intentions of the heart**.”*


### D. The Bible Claims to be the inspired word of God


**Let us look at the claim


#### 1. Paul's message to the Thessalonians was from God

*1 Thess. 2:13*


**Moreover, it has transforming power**

*"And for this reason we also constantly thank God that when you
received from us the word of God's message, you accepted it **not as the
word of men, but for what it really is, the _word of God_**, which
also performs its work in you who believe."*

Q. How was Paul’s message accepted? ... as the word of God

Q. At end of verse, what will God's word do? ... perform its work

Note: God's Word will perform a work in people ... i.e. it has the power
to transform people. We would expect this if the Bible is truly the
inspired word of God. It would have power.

Q. Have you experienced the transforming power of God's word in your
life? How about your salvation?


#### 2. The Gospel is from God

*Galatians 1:11,12*


*11 "For I would have you know, brethren, that **the gospel** which was
preached by me **is not according to man**.*

*12 For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but I
**received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ**."*

Q. This verse is talking about the Gospel.

What does Gospel mean? ... Good news (i.e. of salvation)

Q. How did Paul receive the Gospel?

*… through a revelation of Jesus Christ*


#### 3. The Bible claims to be the spoken word of God:


a\. Statements: “God said ...”, “The Lord said …”, (over 300 times)

Gen. 1:3; 1:20; Exo 16:4; Gen 6:3; Acts 9:15; 18:9; etc.

b\. “The word of the Lord …”, (over 250 times)

Acts 8:25; 11:16; 12:24; 13:48; 15:35; 15:36; 1Thess. 4:15; 1 Peter
1:25; etc.

c\. The Bible refers to itself as the Word of God over 2000 times with
these types of phrases.

**4. All Scripture is God Breathed -** 2 Timothy 3:16 (memory verse)

*"All Scripture is **inspired by God** and profitable for teaching, for
reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness;"*

Q. What does inspired mean?

Inspired --\> God breathed (to breath out)

Q. What is inspired?

The Scripture (words) - not the authors.

Q. How much of the Scripture is inspired? ... ALL!


#### 5. The prophets wrote and did not know what they wrote!

*1 Peter*

1:10,11

*10 "As to this salvation, **the prophets who prophesied** of the grace
that would come to you **made careful search and inquiry**,*

*11 **_seeking to know_** what person or time the Spirit of Christ
within them was indicating as He predicted the sufferings of Christ and
the glories to follow."*

Note: This verse is talking about prophets who were prophesing about
salvation through grace.

Q. However, after they prophesied what did they do? (end of vs. 10 & vs.
11)


Q. Why would the prophets search their own writings for information?

meant.

Q. How many things have you written and not known what you meant?


### E. The Holy Spirit is the key to Inspiration


#### 1. Paul received revelation from God

*1 Corinthians 2:12-13*


*12 "Now **we have received**, not the spirit of the world, but **the
Spirit** who is from God, **that we might know** the things freely given
to us by God,*

*13 which things **we also speak**, not in words taught by human wisdom,
but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual thoughts with
**spiritual _words_**.”*

Q. Who was the source of Paul’s message? … the Spirit

Q. It says in verse 12 that Paul received from the Spirit that “He might
know”.

At the end of verse 13 what did Paul speak?

*… spiritual thoughts with **spiritual words***


#### 2. Samuel experienced God speaking through him

*2 Samuel 23:2-3*


*2 “The Spirit of the Lord spoke by me, And **His word was on my
tongue**.*

*3 “The **God** of Israel **said**, The Rock of Israel spoke to me, 'He
who rules over men righteously, Who rules in the fear of God,”*

Q. Who was the source of Samuel's message? ... the Lord

Note: Samuel was given _words_.


#### 3. No prophecy except by the Holy Spirit

*2 Peter 1:20,21*


*20 "But know this first of all, that no _prophecy of Scripture_ is
a matter of one's own interpretation,*

*21 for **no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men
moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God**."*

Q. What is a prophesy? ... telling forth God's word

Q. What part does man have in this prophesy? ... vs. 21 – he speaks.

Q. How was prophesy given?

The prophet was *"moved by the Holy Spirit"*

Q. Who will was being exibited? vs. 21 … God’s


### F. Verbal Plenary Inspiration


#### 1. Verbal

*the words*


#### 2. Plenary

*the whole*


a\. “*No prophesy (of Scripture) ever made, but … by the Holy Spirit”*

(2 Peter 1:20,21)

b\. *All Scripture is inspired by God* (2 Timothy 3:16)


### G. Parallel passages


(support the claim that the Bible was authored by God)

The following parallel passages are NT quotes of OT passages. But when
reading the NT passage, the author of each OT passage is referred to as
God!

1. **Psalms 16:7-10** - The Psalmist (David) writes

*7 "I will bless the Lord who has counseled me; Indeed, my mind
instructs me in the night.*

8 I have set the Lord continually before me; Because He is at my right
hand, I will not be shaken.

*9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices; My flesh also will
dwell securely.*

*10 For Thou wilt not abandon my soul to Sheol; **Neither wilt Thou
allow Thy Holy One to undergo decay**."*

Parallel passage: **Acts 13:32-35** - Who is speaking?

*32 "And we preach to you the good news of the promise made to the
fathers,*

33 that God has fulfilled this promise to our children in that He raised
up Jesus, as it is also written in the second Psalm, 'Thou art My Son;
today I have begotten Thee.'

*34 And as for the fact that He raised Him up from the dead, no more to
return to decay, He has spoken in this way: 'I will give you the holy
and sure blessings of David.'*

*35 Therefore He also says in another Psalm, **'Thou wilt not allow Thy
Holy One to undergo decay**.'*

2. Other parallel passages:

**Another Example from table:**

⮚ The Psalmist writing - Psalm 45:6,7

*6 "Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever; A scepter of uprightness is
the scepter of Thy kingdom.*

7 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated wickedness; Therefore God,
Thy God, has anointed Thee With the oil of joy above Thy fellows."

⮚ God speaking - Hebrews 1:8,9

*8 "But of the Son He says, 'Thy throne, O God, is forever and ever, And
the righteous scepter is the scepter of His kingdom.*

9 "Thou hast loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; Therefore God,
Thy God, hath anointed Thee With the oil of gladness above Thy
companions.'"

**Point:** When reading the Psalm of David, the author was God.

| **CONCLUSION**                           |
| THE BIBLE CLAIMS TO BE THE WORD OF GOD ! |


## VIII. CANONICITY – HOW WERE THE BOOKS OF THE CANON DECIDED UPON?


### A. The formation of the Canon:


**1. Divine Sovereignty** (see section VII.B, above)

Note: God is in total control of all things (Isa. 46:10; Eph. 1:11)

a\. The Holy Spirit superintended the writing of the books

b\. The Holy Spirit providentially collected and preserved the writings.


#### 2. Human Responsibility


a\. The Church does not determine the Canon

b\. The Church recognizes and receives the Canon


### B. Why these 66 books?


1. The testimony of God the Holy Spirit to the authority of His own
Word.

2. Prophetic authorship - 2 Peter 1:20-21

3. Providential Care - Isa. 40:8; Mat. 5:18; 1Pet 1:25 (see VI.B.2,
above).

4. Validation by Christ (Luke 24:44; Luke 11:51; Matt. 4:4; 4:7; 4:10,
etc.)

(see section IX.A.8, below)

5. God's people responding in recognition, faith and submission.

6. The books claim to be the Word of God.

7. Peter recognized Paul's writings as equal with Scripture – 2Peter
3:15-16.

8. Paul recognized Deut. 25:4 and Luke 10:7 as Scripture – 1 Timothy
5:18.


### C. The Apocrypha


Note: Apocrypha means hidden; hard to understand)

**⮚ The books** (included in the Roman Catholic Apocrypha) - 14 books

1. 1 Esdras

2. 2 Esdras

3. Tobit

4. Judith

5. Additions to Esther

6. Wisdom of Solomon

7. Ecclesiasticus

8. Baruch

9. Addendum to Daniel: The Song of the Three Holy Children

10. Addendum to Daniel: Susanna

11. Addendum to Daniel: Bel and the Dragon

12. The Prayer of Manasseh

13. 1 Maccabees

14. 2 Maccabees

**⮚ Problems with accepting canonicity of the Catholic Apocrypha**

1. Never once quoted in the New Testament.

2. Lack of endorsement by the ancient Jewish writers.

3. Problems with content:

a\. States that Almsgiving can free one from death & hell.

Tobit 4:10-11

“Almsgiving frees one from death, and keeps one from going into the dark
abode. Alms are a worthy offering in the sight of the Most Hight for all
who give them.”

This of course is false. Only the death of Christ, atones for sin, and
is the way to eternal life with the Father. (John 14:6; Heb. 9;22; Rev.
1:5).

b\. The Apocrypha justifies suicide, assassination and praying for the
dead.

(MacArthur, "How to Get the Most from God's Word," page 81.)

Example: 2 Maccabees 12:46

“Thus he made atonement for the dead that they might be freed from this
sin.”

4. No prophetic power - this is a powerful mark of true Scripture.


## IX. THE BELIEVABILITY OF THE BIBLE


Note:

You cannot prove that the Bible is God’s word to an unbeliever, since
they are spiritually dead (Rom. 3:10-18). The Bible is God’s word and as
such it is able to lead to Spiritual life (2 Tim. 3:15). For an
unbeliever, you present the Gospel, through Scripture, and let the
dynamic, life giving Word of God work in the person’s heart. Once saved,
the Holy Spirit will convict the person of the fact that the Bible is
God’s word.

For believers, when looking at the Bible, we would expect the marks of
inspiration to be present.

**a. Christ believed the Law and the Prophets** - Matthew 5:17,18

*17 "Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I did
not come to abolish, but to **fulfill**.*

*18 "For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, **not the
smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law, until all is
accomplished**."*

**b. Christ confirmed Scripture** (through quotations)

created them from the beginning made them male and female,*

*5 and said, 'For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother,
and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh'?*

*6 Consequently they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore
God has joined together, let no man separate.'"*

\(3. Confirms Exodus 3:6 - Matthew 22:31-32

*31 "But regarding the resurrection of the dead, **have you not read**
that which was spoken to you by God, saying,*

*32 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob'? He is not the God of the dead but of the living."*

and the God of Jacob'?*"

**c. Christ believed in Jonah** - Matthew 12:40,41

*"for just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the
sea monster, so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in
the heart of the earth."*

**d. Christ believed the story of Sodom and Gomorrah** - Matthew 10:15

*"Truly I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom
and Gomorrah in the day of judgment, than for that city."*


#### 8. PROPHESIES


Q. But the most important mark of inspiration is prophesy ... Why?

… Only God knows the future.

**a. Birthplace of the Messiah:**

(1). Prophesy: Micah 5:2 (700 years before Christ)

*"But as for you, **Bethlehem Ephrathah**, Too little to be among the
clans of Judah, **From you One will go forth for Me to be ruler in
Israel. His goings forth are from long ago, From the days of
eternity."***

(2). Fulfillment: Luke 2:4-7

*4 "And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to
Judea, to the city of David, which is called **Bethlehem**, because he
was of the house and family of David,*

*5 in order to register, along with Mary, who was engaged to him, and
was with child.*

*6 And it came about that while they were there, the days were completed
for her to give birth.*

*7 And she gave birth to her first-born son; and she wrapped Him in
cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in
the inn."*

**b. Virgin birth of the Messiah**

(1). Prophesy: Isaiah 7:14 (700 years before Christ)

*"Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, **a virgin
will be with child and bear a son**, and she will call His name
**Immanuel**."*

(2). Fulfillment: Matt. 1:18-25

*18 "Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows. When His mother Mary
had been betrothed to Joseph, **before they came together she was found
to be with child by the Holy Spirit**.*

*19 And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man, and not wanting to
disgrace her, desired to put her away secretly.*

*20 But when he had considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord
appeared to him in a dream, saying, 'Joseph, son of David, do not be
afraid to take Mary as your wife; for **that which has been conceived in
her is of the Holy Spirit**.*

*21 And she will bear a Son; and you shall call His name Jesus, for it
is He who will save His people from their sins.'*

*22 Now all this took place that what was spoken by the Lord through the
prophet might be fulfilled, saying,*

*23 'Behold, the **virgin shall be with child**, and shall bear a Son,
and they shall call His name Immanuel,' which translated means, 'God
with us.'*

*24 And Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord
commanded him, and took her as his wife,*

*25 and **kept her a virgin until she gave birth** to a Son; and he
called His name Jesus."*

**c. His Triumphal Entry**

(1). Prophesy: Zechariah 9:9 (500 years before Christ)

*"Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout in triumph, O daughter of
Jerusalem! Behold, **your king is coming to you**; He is just and
**endowed with salvation, Humble, and mounted on a donkey**, Even on **a
colt**, the foal of a donkey."*

(2). Fulfillment: John 12:12-15

*12 "On the next day the great multitude who had come to the feast, when
they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,*

*13 took the branches of the palm trees, and went out to meet Him, and
began to cry out, 'Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the
Lord, even the King of Israel.'*

*14 And Jesus, finding a **young donkey**, sat on it; as it is written,*

*15 'Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, **your King is coming, seated
on a donkey's colt**.'"*

**d. Christ's crucifixion**

\(1. Predicted a thousand years before Christ's death and hundreds of
years before this form of execution was ever used.

**(2) Prophesy:** Psalms 22:14-18

*14 "I am poured out like water, And **all my bones are out of joint**;
My heart is like wax; It is melted within me.*

*15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd, And **my tongue cleaves to
my jaws**; And Thou dost lay me in the dust of death.*

*16 For dogs have surrounded me; A band of evildoers has encompassed me;
**They pierced my hands and my feet**.*

*17 **I can count all my bones**. **They look, they stare at me**;*

*18 **They divide my garments among them, And for my clothing they cast
lots**."*

**(3) Fulfillment:**

\(a\) John 19:23-37

*23 The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took His
outer garments and made four parts, a part to every soldier and also the
tunic; now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece.*

*24 They said therefore to one another, "**Let us not tear it, but cast
lots for it, to decide whose it shall be"; that the Scripture might be
fulfilled, "_They divided My outer garments among them, and for My
clothing they cast lots_**."*

*25 Therefore the soldiers did these things. But there were standing by
the cross of Jesus His mother, and His mother's sister, Mary the wife of
Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.*

*26 When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and the disciple whom He loved
standing nearby, He said to His mother, "Woman, behold, your son!"*

*27 Then He said to the disciple, "Behold, your mother!" And from that
hour the disciple took her into his own household*

*28 After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had already been
accomplished, **in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said,
"_I am thirsty._"***

*29 A jar full of sour wine was standing there; so they put a sponge
full of the sour wine upon a branch of hyssop, and brought it up to His
mouth.*

*30 When Jesus therefore had received the sour wine, He said, "It is
finished!" And He bowed His head, and gave up His spirit.*

*31 The Jews therefore, because it was the day of preparation, so that
the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that
Sabbath was a high day), asked Pilate that their legs might be broken,
and that they might be taken away.*

*32 The soldiers therefore came, and broke the legs of the first man,
and of the other man who was crucified with Him;*

*33 but coming to Jesus, **when they saw that He was already dead, they
_did not break His legs_**;*

*34 but one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and
immediately there came out blood and water.*

*35 And he who has seen has borne witness, and his witness is true; and
he knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe*

*36 **For these things came to pass, that the Scripture might be
fulfilled, "Not a bone of Him shall be broken.**"*

*37 And again another Scripture says, **"They shall look on Him whom
they pierced."***

**e. Isaiah Predicted Christ's Suffering**

\(1. Predicted a 700 years before it happened.

**(2) Prophesy:** Isaiah 53:4-7

*4 "Surely **our griefs He Himself bore**, And our sorrows He carried;
Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken, **Smitten of God**, and
afflicted.*

*5 But **_He was pierced through for our transgressions_**, **He
was crushed for our iniquities; The chastening for our well-being fell
upon Him, And by His scourging we are healed**.*

*6 All of us like sheep have gone astray, Each of us has turned to his
own way; But **the Lord has caused the iniquity of us all To fall on
Him**.*

*7 He was oppressed and He was afflicted, Yet **He did not open His
mouth**; **Like _a lamb_ that is led to slaughter**, And like a
sheep that is silent before its shearers, So He did not open His
mouth."*

**(2) Fulfillment**

\(a\) Matthew 26:63

*"But **Jesus kept silent**. And the high priest said to Him, "I adjure
You by the living God, that You tell us whether You are the Christ, the
Son of God."*

\(b\) Matthew 27:12

*"And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, **He
made no answer**."*

\(c\) Matthew 27:13

*13 "Then Pilate said to Him, "Do You not hear how many things they
testify against You?"*

*14 And **He did not answer him with regard to even a single charge**,
so that the governor was quite amazed."*

\(d\) 1 Peter 2:24

*"and **He Himself bore our sins in His body** on the cross, that we
might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were
healed."*

## X. APPLICATION


### A. Questions


1. Do you believe what the Bible says is true?

2. Do you believe that the Bible is God's word?

3. Do you believe that every word of the Bible was breathed out by God?

Note: It will change the way you approach and respond to it.


### B. The Importance of the Bible

*Section "IV" of Lesson 1*


**1. Able to lead to salvation** (IV.B.1) - 2 Timothy 3:15

*"and that from childhood you have known **the sacred writings which are
able to give you the wisdom that _leads to salvation_** through
faith which is in Christ Jesus."*

two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit,
of both joints and marrow, and **able to judge the thoughts and
intentions of the heart**."*
