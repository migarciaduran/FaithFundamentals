***Fundamentals of the Faith***

**Lesson \#10**

**Spiritual Gifts**

**══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════**

**I. GENERAL**

**\* A. Spiritual giftedness - definition**

*Spiritual Gifts* are God given capacities for spiritual service,
supernaturally bestowed upon believers only.

**B. Origin of word:** The English word comes from two principle Greek
words:

(This section from John MacArthur, The MacArthur N.T. Commentary, 1
Corinthians, pg. 290)

1\. *Charismata*

a\. root is *charis* - meaning grace or undeserved favor

b\. we get *charismatic* from this same root

c\. "the gift of grace" or "free gift"

d\. 17 times in N.T. - 16 times connected with God as the giver

e\. Paul uses it in reference to salvation (Romans 5:15-16; 6:23)

**Note:** It is a gift.

You don't work for it or strive for it (Quiz question \#2)

A gift is given to you. It is free.

2\. *Pneumatika*

a\. Spiritualities; something from the Spirit

b\. Indicates the source is from God

**Note:** It is spiritual in nature

Not a physical talent

**C. Different from talents**

1\. Both have their origin in God

2\. They may work together

3\. Note: Talents .... come from natural birth

Gifts ....... come from the second birth

Therefore: Believers and non-believers have talents

Only believers have spiritual giftedness

**II. THE GIVING OF SPIRITUAL GIFTS**

Q. Who is the source of spiritual giftedness? (LESSON I, pg. 73)

**A. The Holy Spirit** - 1 Corinthians 12:11 (LESSON I.A.1)

*"But one and **the** same **Spirit** works all these things,
**distributing to each one** **individually** just as He wills."*

**B. God** - 1 Corinthians 12:28 (LESSON I.A.2)

*"And **God has appointed** in the church, first apostles, second
prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps,
administrations, various kinds of tongues."*

\* **C. <u>All Christians</u> have been given a special gift** - 1 Peter
4:10 (LESSON I.B)

*"As **each one has received a special gift**, employ it in serving one
another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God."*

Q. Who possesses spiritual giftedness?

Q. Who is "*each one*"? ... Peter is addressing Christians (context
verse 3:21)

... all Christians

**Note:**

Q. If all ChristianS have a ***spiritual gift*** then when did they
receive it?

... at the time of salvation

Q. Again, when do Christians receive their spiritual gift?

... at the time of salvation

Q. How many Christians have a spiritual gift?

... all Christians

</tbody>

Q. Note, what else can you learn from 1 Peter 4:10?

In the beginning of the verse, what is the significance of the article
"*a*"?

... one, a singular gift!

\_ ***Gift*** is singular

Q. What is the significance?

... it is one gift or giftedness

... it is a unique mixture of all the gifts!

**D. Your spiritual gift is unique**

1\. Your gift is a mixture of several gifts - like a painting

2\. The Holy Spirit paints you for given ministries

traits and experiences and the needs of the church.</p>
<p>Each believer becomes as unique spiritually as his fingerprints are
physically."</p>
<p>John MacArthur, The MacArthur N.T. Commentary, 1 Corinthians, pg.

4\. **Example:** The church is like a football team

Many team members - each uniquely gifted

Quarterback - needs quickness, throwing abilities

Receiver - quickness, catching ability; does not have to be a good
thrower

Kicker - has to be a great kicker; that is all; but that's enough

Q. What would happen if the kicker decided to take on the job of
quarterback?

Q. Or, the quarterback, becoming the kicker?

Q. What happens if the quarterback decides not to play?

In the same way the church is made up of many members

Each is uniquely gifted for different ministries within the Church

We need to all be in the game

But doing what we are uniquely gifted by God to do

\* \_ 1 Corinthians 12:14, 17-19

*14 "For the body is not one member, but many.*

*17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the
whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?*

*18 But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body,
just as He desired.*

*19 And if they were all one member, where would the body be?"*

\_ That leads us to the purpose of spiritual gifts ...

**III. THE MINISTRY AND PURPOSE OF SPIRITUAL GIFTS**

**A. For the common good** - 1 Corinthians 12:7 (LESSON I.C.1)

*"But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit **for the
common good**."*

Q. The common good of who?

... the church (see below)

**B. For the edification of the church** - 1 Corinthians 14:12 (LESSON
I.C.2)

*"So also you, since you are zealous of **spiritual gifts**, seek to
**abound for the <u>edification</u> of the church**."*

Q. What is edification?

... "to build up"

\* **C. Serving one another** (refer back to 1 Peter 4:10 - LESSON I.C)

*"As **each one has received a special gift, employ it in <u>serving one
another</u>**, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God."*

Q. Again - how many Christians have received a spiritual gift? ... all
Christians

Q. From the second part of the verse - what are we suppose to do?

... employ it

... in service

Q. What does *employ mean*? ... a command; do it

Q. Note: *steward*. What is a steward? ... someone entrusted with
something

... in this context - entrusted to employ our gifts in service within
the Church

Q. Who are we suppose to serve? ... one another

Q. Are we suppose to use the gift to serve or edify ourselves? ... no

... spiritual gifts are not meant for self edification

... spiritual gifts are for the edification of others

**D. The context of the giving of the spiritual gifts**

\_ The context of the giving of *spiritual gifts* is that of the body of
Christ, and the need for each member to carry out his or her God-given
function.

\* \_ The Spiritual gifts are listed in 1 Cor. 12:4-11

Note the context of the chapters before and after the giving of the
gifts:

1 Cor. 11:18 ........... Warnings against division within the Church

1 Cor. 12:4-11 ......... The Spiritual gifts given

1 Cor. 12:12-26 ....... Body concept of the Church

1 Cor. 13 ............... Love chapter

1 Cor. 14 ............... Tongues - warning chapter

Note: 1 Corinthians 12:25 (LESSON III.C, pg. 77)

*"that there should be no division in the body, but that the members
should have the same care for one another."*

Q. What are the two commands given here?

... no divisions in the body

... care for one another

**Points:**

The context is the "*unity and function*" of the body of Christ

Each member is exhorted to function for the care and good of the Church

Gifts are not for yourself, but for the functioning & care of the Church

Gifts must be exercised in love ("Love Chapter", below)

S **E. Our gifts must be ministered in LOVE** - 1 Corinthians 13:1-7

**Note:** This chapter is squeezed between chapters 12 & 13, which major
on spiritual gifts.

(LESSON III.A, pg. 77, end of lesson)

*1 "If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, **but do not have
love**, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.*

*2 And if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries and all
knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do
not have love, I am nothing.*

*3 And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I deliver
my body to be burned, but do not have love, it profits me nothing.*

*4 **<u>Love is</u>** **patient**, love is **kind**, and is **not
jealous**; love **does not brag** and is **not arrogant**,*

*5 **does not act unbecomingly**; it **does not seek its own**, is **not
provoked**, **does not take into account a wrong suffered**,*

*6 **does not rejoice in unrighteousness**, but **rejoices with the
truth**;*

*7 **bears all things**, **believes all things**, **hopes all things**,
**endures all things**."*

**IV. A LOOK AT THE GIFTS**

**A. The Number of Gifts** - scholars disagree - from 9 to 22

**1. Because the lists are not identical**

God did not give a rigid, precise and exhaustive compilation

Rather - general categories

**Note:** Be careful not to over define - the Bible is not that specific

\* **2. Gifted people** - appointed - (not gifts) - Ephesians 4:11

*"And He gave some as **apostles**, and some as **prophets**, and some
as **evangelists**, and some as **pastors** and **teachers**,"*

**Some accept these as gifts**

I **We believe these were gifted men appointed by God to the church**

\- 1 Corinthians 12:28

*"And **God has appointed** in the church, first apostles, second
prophets, third teachers, **then** miracles, **<u>then gifts</u>** of
healings, helps, administrations, various kinds of tongues."*

**Note:** *Appointed* means to set or place, indicates an official
appointment to an office (cf. John 15:16; Acts 20:28; 2Tim. 1:11)

You don't receive the gift of Apostle - it is an appointment

**Note:** We saw last week that the office of apostle and prophet have
passed away (see LESSON 9, page 7, section II.B)

**B. Categories:**

I 1. According to their nature - speaking, serving - 1 Peter 4:11

*"**Whoever speaks, let him speak**, as it were, the utterances of God;
**whoever serves**, let him do so as by the strength which God supplies;
so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom
belongs the glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen."*

2\. According to their aspects - motivation, ministries, manifestations

3\. According to their duration - permanent or temporary

**Note:** You don't divide over such issues.

The Bible is not that specific.

**C. The permanent gifts** (See LESSON II.B, pg. 74)

**1. Prophecy**

I A gift to be coveted by the Church because it builds the church up

1 Corinthians 14:3

*"But **one who prophesies** <u>speaks to men for edification and
exhortation and consolation</u>."*

To foretell the future

To proclaim the Word of God

We believe that with the completion of Scripture, direct revelation
ceased and so did the *foretelling* part of the gift.

\_ Note the warning at the end of the Book of Revelation.

Also, note, Revelation was the last book written.

\* Revelation 22:18-21

*18 "I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this
book: **if anyone adds to them, God shall add to him the plagues which
are written in this book**;*

*19 and **if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this
prophecy, God shall take away his part from the tree of life** and from
the holy city, which are written in this book.*

*20 He who testifies to these things says, 'Yes, I am coming quickly.'
Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.*

*21 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all. Amen.*"

══════════════════════════════════

**The Word Faith Movement**

\_ Does God still give revelation? ... we believe the Bible is closed

\_ Is the Canon still open? .... allows opening to demonic lies

\_ People are saying, "The Lord said ..." ... is God speaking to people
today?

\_ Jack Hayford ... saw Jesus on the right hand of the Father, robe ...

\_ Copeland - school of prophets - train to be a prophet

\_ Charisma - most popular magazine

\_ 382 million Pentacostals

\_ 2/3 live in third world countries

══════════════════════════════════

**\_ See the lesson for definition of the following gifts:**

2\. Teaching

3\. Faith

4\. Wisdom

5\. Knowledge

6\. Discernment

7\. Mercy

8\. Exhortation

9\. Giving

10\. Administration/ Leadership

11\. Helps

12\. Service

**D. The temporary gifts**

1\. Tongues/ interpretation of tongues

2\. Healing

3\. Miracles

\_ **We believe:** They ceased to be evident as the church was
established

\* \_ **The Purpose**

**Confirmation of the gospel** - Hebrews 2:3-4

*3 "how shall we escape if we neglect so great a **salvation**? After it
was at the first spoken through the Lord, <u>it was confirmed to us</u>
by those who heard,*

*4 **God also bearing witness** with them, both **by signs and wonders
and by various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit** according to
His own will."*

**Confirmation of the apostles** - 2 Corinthians 12:12

*"The <u>signs of a true apostle</u> were performed among you with all
perseverance, by **signs** and **wonders** and **miracles**."*

**Attested to the deity of Christ** - Acts 2:22

*"Men of Israel, listen to these words: **Jesus the Nazarene**, <u>a man
attested to</u> you by God with **miracles and wonders and signs** which
God performed through Him in your midst, just as you yourselves know--"*

**Gift of tongues was a special sign gift**

\_ **NOTE: The original purpose is no longer needed**

We have been given the gospel, we have the Bible - it has been confirmed

The offices of apostles & prophets have passed away - the sign gifts are
no longer needed to attest to their authority

Christ is now revealed to us through the Holy Spirit and through the
Bible

**1. Tongues/ interpretation of tongues**

Manifested by the speaking of a language unknown to the speaker. This
gift had to be accompanied by the gift of interpretation.

(Will be developed, two sections ahead)

**2. The gift of healing**

**a. Who had the gift?**

\* **(1) Christ** - Matthew 4:23

*"And **Jesus** was going about **in all Galilee**, teaching in their
synagogues, and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and **healing
<u>every kind</u> of disease and <u>every kind</u> of sickness** among
the people."*

\* **(2) The disciples** - Matthew 10:1

*"And having summoned His twelve disciples, **He gave them authority
over** unclean spirits, to cast them out, and **to heal every kind of
disease and every kind of sickness**."*

\* **(3) The seventy** - Luke 10:1,9

*1 "Now after this **the Lord appointed seventy others**, and sent them
two and two ahead of Him to every city and place where He Himself was
going to come.*

*9 and **heal those in it who are sick**, and say to them, 'The kingdom
of God has come near to you.'"*

I **(4) Associates of the apostles** (Philip) - Acts 8:5-7

*5 "And **Philip** went down to the city of Samaria and began
proclaiming Christ to them.*

*6 And the multitudes with one accord were giving attention to what was
said by Philip, as they heard and saw the signs which he was
performing.*

*7 For in the case of many who had unclean spirits, they were coming out
of them shouting with a loud voice; and **many who had been paralyzed
and lame were healed**."*

\* **b. No one today can heal like Jesus and the apostles did**

Word or touch

Instantaneously

Totally

All who came

Raised from the dead

**c. Paul used the gift sparingly**

Did not heal himself

Did not heal Epaproditus - Philippians 2:27

Did not heal Timothy - 1 Timothy 5:23

**3. The gift of miracles**

**1. Definition:**

A supernatural intrusion into the natural world and its natural laws. An
event explainable only by divine intrusion.

**2. Examples of Christ's miracles:**

Jesus turning water into wine - John 2:11

Jesus calming the sea - Matthew 8:26

Feeding the 4000 - Matthew 15:32-39

Feeding the 5000 - Matthew 14:14-21

Walking on water - Matthew 14:24-33

Many other signs - John 20:30-31

I \_ John 20:30-31

*30 "**Many other signs therefore Jesus also performed** in the presence
of the disciples, which are not written in this book;*

*31 but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the
Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you may have life in His
name."*

**Note:** No disciple did a miracle of nature.

**V. THE DISCOVERY OF YOUR GIFT**

**A. We should all be ministering in many of the gifted areas**

Q. If you do not have the gift of *giving*, do you not give?

If you do not have the gift of *helps*, do you not help?

If you do not have the give of *mercy*, do you not show mercy?

**\_ Some Christians are just <u>specially gifted</u>** in different
areas for ministry.

I,S **\_ All Christians should exhibit:** (LESSON IV.A, pg. 78, box)

a\. Faith - 2 Corinthians 5:7

*"for we walk by faith, not by sight--"*

b\. Wisdom (pray for it) - James 1:5

*"But **if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God**, who gives to
all men generously and without reproach, and it will be given to him."*

c\. Knowledge - 2 Timothy 2:15

*"Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does
not need to be ashamed, **handling accurately the word of truth**."*

d\. Exhortation - Hebrews 10:25

*"not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some,
but **encouraging one another**; and all the more, as you see the day
drawing near."*

e\. Giving - 2 Corinthians 9:7

*"Let **each one** do just as he has purposed in his heart; not
grudgingly or under compulsion; for **God loves a cheerful giver**."*

f\. Care for one another (helps) - 1 Corinthians 12:25

*"that there should be no division in the body, but that **the members
should have the same care for one another**."*

**B. Finding your giftedness**

1\. The Bible does not specifically say how

2\. Move out in faith - let God guide you into ministry

3\. Be obedient in the areas above, some areas may stand out!

4\. Some believe in taking tests to find your gift

... not really much value

**VI. EXPANSION ON THE GIFT OF TONGUES**

S **A. Pentecost - languages** - Acts 2:1-13

*1 "And when the **day of Pentecost** had come, they were all together
in one place.*

*2 And suddenly there came from heaven a noise like a violent, rushing
wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.*

*3 And there appeared to them **tongues** as of fire distributing
themselves, and they rested on each one of them.*

*4 And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and **began to speak
with other tongues**, as the Spirit was giving them utterance.*

*5 Now there were Jews living in Jerusalem, devout men, from every
nation under heaven.*

*6 And when this sound occurred, the multitude came together, and were
bewildered, because **they were each one hearing them speak in his own
<u>language</u>**.*

*7 And they were amazed and marveled, saying, 'Why, are not all these
who are speaking Galileans?*

*8 'And how is it that **we each hear them in our own <u>language</u> to
which we were born**?*

*9 'Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia,
Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,*

*10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the districts of Libya around
Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both Jews and proselytes,*

*11 Cretans and Arabs-- **we hear them in our own tongues** speaking of
the mighty deeds of God.'*

*12 And they all continued in amazement and great perplexity, saying to
one another, 'What does this mean?'*

*13 But others were mocking and saying, 'They are full of sweet wine.'"*

**Note:** Word for tongues is ***glossa*** - "the tongue; a language"

Q. There were three groups, who were they?

1\. The ones in the upper room that the Holy Spirit fell upon

2\. Devout Jews from every nation (verse 5)

3\. Those who did not understand (verse 13)

Q. How did the men from every nation hear the Galileans speaking?

... heard them in their own language of the day

**Note:** To the mocking Jews - tongues were a sign of judgement

**B. The purpose of tongues**

\* **1. A sign for unbelieving Jews** - 1 Corinthians 14:21-22

*21 "In the Law it is written, 'By men of strange tongues and by the
lips of strangers I will speak to this people, and even so they will not
listen to Me,' says the Lord.*

*22 So then **tongues are for a sign**, not to those who believe, but
**to unbelievers**; but prophecy is for a sign, not to unbelievers, but
to those who believe."*

**2. Attested to the acceptance of the Gentiles into the body of
Christ**

\_ Note: The Gentiles were outsiders to the Jewish religion.

They were not accepted as chosen of God.

It was important that the same sign that was given at the time of
Pentecost accompanied the conversion of the Gentiles.

**a. The Gentiles - Peter and Cornelius** - Acts 10:44-48

*44 "While Peter was still speaking these words, **the Holy Spirit fell
upon all those who were listening to the message**.*

*45 And all the circumcised believers who had come with Peter were
amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out upon the
Gentiles also.*

*46 For they were hearing them speaking with tongues and exalting God.
Then Peter answered,*

*47 '**Surely no one can refuse the water for these to be baptized
<u>who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did</u>, can he?**'*

*48 And he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then
they asked him to stay on for a few days."*

**NOTE:**

Q. How did the Gentiles receive the Holy Spirit? (verse 47)

... they received the Holy Spirit in the same way that Peter did in

Acts 2:4-11 (above)

A sign to cause the Gentiles to be accepted into the church by the Jews:

(see passages on the next page)

1\. Peter defending the Gentiles before the Jews - Acts 11:1-18

2\. Peter recapping before the Jewish Pharisees - Acts 15:3-9

**\_ Peter defending the Gentiles**

**Peter before the Jews** - Acts 11:1-18

*1 "Now **the apostles and the brethren who were throughout Judea heard
that the Gentiles also had received the word of God**.*

*2 **And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those who were circumcised
took issue with him**,*

*3 saying, 'You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them.'*

*4 But Peter began speaking and proceeded to explain to them in orderly
sequence, saying,*

*...*

*15 'And as I began to speak, **the Holy Spirit fell upon them, <u>just
as He did upon us at the beginning</u>**.*

*16 'And I remembered the word of the Lord, how He used to say, 'John
baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'*

*17 '**If God therefore gave to them the same gift as He gave to us also
after believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could stand
in God's way?**'"*

*18 And when they heard this, they quieted down, and glorified God,
saying, **"Well then, God has granted to the Gentiles also the
repentance that leads to life.**"*

**The Jerusalem Council** - Acts 15:5-9

*5 "But certain ones of the sect of the Pharisees who had believed,
stood up, saying, 'It is necessary to circumcise them, and to direct
them to observe the Law of Moses.'*

*6 And the apostles and the elders came together to look into this
matter.*

*7 And after there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to
them, 'Brethren, you know that in the early days God made a choice among
you, that **by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel
and believe**.*

*8 '**And God**, who knows the heart, bore witness to them, **giving
them the Holy Spirit, <u>just as He also did to us</u>**;*

*9 and **He made no distinction between us and them**, cleansing their
hearts by faith.'"*

**b. The followers of John the Baptist** - Acts 19:1-7

(The last group mentioned in the context of tongues in the book of Acts)

*1 "And it came about that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having
passed through the upper country came to Ephesus, and found some
disciples,*

*2 and he said to them, '**Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you
believed?' And they said to him, 'No, we have not even heard whether
there is a Holy Spirit.**'*

*3 And he said, 'Into what then were you baptized?' And they said, 'Into
John baptism.'*

*4 And Paul said, 'John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling
the people to believe in Him who was coming after him, that is, in
Jesus.'*

*5 And **when they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the
Lord Jesus**.*

*6 And **when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on
them, and they began speaking with tongues** and prophesying.*

*7 And there were in all about twelve men."*

**NOTE:**

They were not Christians before Paul arrived. They had not heard the
gospel.

**They received the Holy Spirit after their baptism and the laying on of
hands.**

Why did Paul have to lay on his hands for them to receive the Holy
Spirit?

\- Acts is a transitional book; not a doctrinal book

\- Acts is about the birth of the church

\- From Judaism to Christianity

**\_ Some say:** You can receive the Baptism of the Holy Spirit sometime
after the point of salvation.

**\_ Remember:** You are not a Christian if you do not have the Holy
Spirit. (see next page)

**Misconceptions about**

***The Baptism of the Holy Spirit* and *Tongues***

**\_ Some say:**

You can receive the Holy Spirit sometime after you become a Christian.
Is this true?

**False:**

\* **You are not a Christian if you do not have the Holy Spirit** -
Romans 8:9

*"However, you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the
Spirit of God dwells in you. But **if anyone does not have the Spirit of
Christ, he does not belong to Him**."*

**\_ Some say:**

You have to speak in tongues or you are not a Christian!

**False:**

\* **The following passage is written to Christians** - 1 Corinthians
12:28-31

*28 "And God has appointed in the church, first <u>apostles</u>, second
<u>prophets</u>, third <u>teachers</u>, then <u>miracles</u>, then gifts
of <u>healings</u>, <u>helps</u>, <u>administrations</u>, various kinds
of <u>tongues</u>.*

*29 All are not apostles, are they? All are not prophets, are they? All
are not teachers, are they? All are not workers of miracles, are they?*

*30 All do not have gifts of healings, do they? **All do not speak with
tongues, do they?** All do not interpret, do they?*

*31 But earnestly desire the greater gifts. And I show you a still more
excellent way."*

Q. What is the implied answer to each of the above questions? ... no

Q. Do all speak in tongues (verse 30)? ... no

**C. The warning about tongues**

\_ 1 Corinthians 14:1-19

*1 **"Pursue love**, yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but
especially that you may prophesy.*

*2 For one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men, but to God; for
no one understands, but in his spirit he speaks mysteries.*

*3 But one who prophesies speaks to men for **edification and
exhortation and consolation**.*

*4 **One who speaks in a tongue <u>edifies himself</u>**; but one who
prophesies **edifies the church**.*

*5 Now I wish that you all spoke in tongues, but even more that you
would prophesy; and greater is one who prophesies than one who speaks in
tongues, unless he interprets, **so that the church may receive
edifying**.*

*6 But now, brethren, **if I come to you speaking in tongues, what shall
I profit you**, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation or of
knowledge or of prophecy or of teaching?*

*7 Yet even lifeless things, either flute or harp, in producing a sound,
if they do not produce a distinction in the tones, how will it be known
what is played on the flute or on the harp?*

*8 For if the bugle produces an indistinct sound, who will prepare
himself for battle?*

*9 So also you, unless you utter by the tongue speech that is clear, how
will it be known what is spoken? For **you will be speaking into the
air**.*

*10 There are, perhaps, a great many kinds of languages in the world,
and no kind is without meaning.*

*11 If then I do not know the meaning of the language, I shall be to the
one who speaks a barbarian, and the one who speaks will be a barbarian
to me.*

*12 So also you, since you are zealous of spiritual gifts, **seek to
abound for the edification of the church**.*

*13 **<u>Therefore</u> let one who speaks in a tongue pray that he may
<u>interpret</u>.***

*14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is
unfruitful.*

*15 What is the outcome then? I shall pray with the spirit and I shall
pray with the mind also; I shall sing with the spirit and I shall sing
with the mind also.*

*16 Otherwise if you bless in the spirit only, how will the one who
fills the place of the ungifted say the "Amen" at your giving of thanks,
since he does not know what you are saying?*

*17 For you are giving thanks well enough, but the other man is not
edified.*

*18 I thank God, I speak in tongues more than you all;*

*19 however, **in the church I desire to speak five words with my mind,
that I may instruct others also, rather than ten thousand words in a
tongue**."*

**NOTE:**

Tongues are not denied - verses 5,13,18

Paul spoke in tongues - verse 18

**HOWEVER:** What is the main point of the passage?

Warning against the improper use of tongues

There must be an interpreter - verse 13 (see 1 Cor. 14:28, next page)

Tongues do not edify the church but self - verse 4

**RATHER:**

Strive to edify the church - verses 4,5,6,12,19

Prophecy, teaching & instruction should be the priority - verses 1,6,19

**REMEMBER:**

Gifts are not meant to edify oneself (section III, above)

**D. Tongues regulated**

\* 1. 1 Corinthians 14:26-28,40

*26 "What is the outcome then, brethren? When you assemble, each one has
a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, **has a tongue, has an
interpretation**. Let all things be done for <u>edification</u>.*

*27 If anyone speaks in a tongue, it should be by **two or at the most
three, and each in turn, and let one interpret**;*

*28 but **if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the
church**; and let him speak to himself and to God.*

*40 "But **let all things be done properly and in an <u>orderly
manner</u>**."*

Q. What regulation is put on tongues?

... 2 or 3, and in turn (verse 27)

... must have an interpreter - or keep silent (verse 28)

... goal is the building up (edification) (verse 26)

Q. What does interpretation imply?

... revelation is being given from God

Q. Is there a need today for further revelation from God?

... no, we have the revealed Bible, they did not

\* **E. Do tongues exist today?**

1\. The original purposes of tongues no longer exist today

A sign to the unbelieving Jews

\- As a sign of God's judgement

\- In confirming the Gentiles into the church

Revelation from God through interpretation

2\. The true manifestation of the gift of tongues is not evidenced today

What is seen is Tongues at the forefront ... uncontrolled

1 Cor. 14 could be written as warning to the Pentecostal Church of today

3\. Tongues will cease - 1 Corinthians 13:8

*"Love never fails; but if there are gifts of prophecy, they will be
done away; **if there are tongues, they will cease**; if there is
knowledge, it will be done away."*

**VII. APPLICATION**

**A. Review**

1\. We all have been gifted by God - uniquely

2\. We must use our gift for the common good of the body of Christ

3\. Our gift will be useless if not exercised in love

4\. We use our gift to serve each other - building each other up

\* **B. Exhortation to exercise your gift** - Romans 12:6-8

*6 "And since we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to
us, **let each exercise them accordingly**: if prophecy, according to
the proportion of his faith;*

*7 if service, in his serving; or he who teaches, in his teaching;*

*8 or he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who gives, with liberality;
he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness."*

Q. What is Paul exhorting us to do?

... get busy ministering our gift
