work."*

*"but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, **always being ready to
make a defense** to everyone who asks you to give an account **for the
hope that is in you**, yet with gentleness and reverence;"*

Q. What should we be able to do? .. be ready to make a defense for our
hope

Q. What is the hope within us? Acts 24:15; Rom. 5:2,5

to Thy lovingkindness.*

*160 The sum of **Thy word is truth**, And every one of Thy righteous
ordinances is everlasting.*

*161 Princes persecute me without cause, But my heart stands in awe of
Thy words.*

*162 **I rejoice at Thy word, As one who finds great spoil**.*

*163 I hate and despise falsehood, But **I love Thy law**.*

*164 Seven times a day I praise Thee, Because of Thy righteous
ordinances.*

*165 Those who love Thy law have great peace, And nothing causes them to
stumble."*

#### 2. What happens if we don't follow God's law?

in Thy sight. Consider too, that this nation is Thy people."*

Q. What did Moses desire? ... to know Thee ... _not_ to know
_about_ God

Hebrew "yada" – to know; to comprehend; to understand

2. We can know God - John 17:3

*"And this is eternal life, that **they may know Thee**, the only true
God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent."*

for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and
has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."*

him, he bears much fruit; for **apart from Me you can do nothing**."*

live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and delivered Himself up
for me."*


#### 4. Paul summed it up: To live is Christ

*Philippians 1:21*


*"For to me, **to live is Christ**, and to die is gain."*

need, before you ask Him**.*
