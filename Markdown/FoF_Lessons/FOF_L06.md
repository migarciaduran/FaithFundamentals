**II. GOD'S SOVEREIGNTY IN SALVATION**

**A. The Process of Salvation** - Romans 8:29-30 (LESSON 6, pg. 41,
I.A.1)

*29 "For whom He **foreknew**, He also **predestined** to become
conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the first-born among
many brethren;*

*30 and whom He predestined, these He also **called**; and whom He
called, these He also **justified**; and whom He justified, these He
also **glorified**."*

**B. Foreknowledge & Predestination**

**1. Chosen According to the Foreknowledge of God** - 1 Peter 1:1,2

*1 "Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who reside as aliens,
scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
**who are chosen***

*2 **according to the foreknowledge of God the Father**, by the
sanctifying work of the Spirit, that you may obey Jesus Christ and be
sprinkled with His blood: May grace and peace be yours in fullest
measure."*

Q. Who chose who? Did they choose God? ... no, God chose them.

Q. What was God's choice based on? ... His foreknowledge

Q. What is foreknowledge?

... goes beyond knowing beforehand

... greek word *proginosko*

⮚ *Proginosko*

► *pro* – beforehand

► *ginosko* - to know in an <u>intimate way</u>

► Virgin - did not **know** (*ginosko*) her - Matthew 1:25

*"and kept her a **virgin** until she gave birth to a Son; and he called
His name Jesus."*

⮚ **Note:** God intimately foreknew us (a love relationship) -
**Forelove**

Q. What does it mean that God based His choice according to His
foreknowledge?

Q. Does this mean that God looked to the end of history to know who
would believe and then chose those persons to be saved?

**Predestination cannot be explained by God's Foreknowledge**

1\. Many people try to resolve the predestination issue this way?

Q. Is this Biblical? ... No

<tr>
<td><p>"In His omniscience God is certainly able to look to the end of
history and beyond and to know in advance the minutest detail of the
most insignificant occurrences. But it is both unbiblical and illogical
to argue from that truth that the Lord simply looked ahead to see who
would believe and then chose those particular individuals for
salvation.</p>
<p>If that were true, salvation not only would begin with man's faith
but would make God obligated to grant it. In such a scheme, God's
initiative would be eliminated and His grace would be vitiated."</p>

pg. 494-495</p></td>

2\. Further problems with the "Foreknowledge on Predestination" view:

⮚ "If God based salvation on His advance knowledge of those who would
believe, where did their saving faith come from?"

Note: It could not come from their fallen nature.

They are blind and dead to the things of God

Review section I, above.

⮚ The Natural man does not accepts the things of God - 1 Corinthians
2:14

They are foolishness to him

*"But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God; for
they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they
are spiritually appraised."*

**2. Chosen According to the kind Intention of His will** - Ephesians
1:4-5

*4 "just as **He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world**,
that we should be holy and blameless before Him. In love*

*5 **He predestined us** to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to
Himself, **according to the kind intention of His will**,*"

Q. Again, who does the choosing? ... God

Q. Who is the "us"? ... believers

Q. When did He chose us? ...

... before the foundation of the world!

Q. How long ago was that?

... before creation

Q. Not only did He chose what else did God do?

... He predestined us.

⮚ **Predestination**

► To set the destiny of

► To be marked out, appointed or determined beforehand.

► To set the destiny of every person who will believe in Him.

Q. Why did He chose one over another?

... *according to the kind intention of **His will***

Q. What does "*His will*" mean? ... He purposes to do it.

**3. According to God's purpose** - 2 Timothy 1:9

*"who has saved us, and **called us** with a holy calling, not according
to our works, but **according to His own purpose** and grace which was
granted us in Christ Jesus **from all eternity**,"*

Q. On what basis were we called?

... *According to His purpose*

**III. MAN'S RESPONSIBILITY IN SALVATION**

**A. God's "Will of Desire" - Wishes that none perish**

**1. Wishing for all to come to repentance** - 2 Peter 3:9

*"The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is
patient toward you, **not wishing for any to perish but for all to come
to repentance**."*

the truth."*

Q. How many people does God desire would be saved? ... all

**B. God's offers and open call to the world**

1\. John 3:16

*"For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that
**whoever** believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life."*

2\. Romans 10:13

*"for **'Whoever** will call upon the name of the Lord will be saved.'"*

Q. What kind of call is given out? ... an open call to the whole world.

Q. Why does not He just call them all to salvation?

... People are unwilling - He created man as free will beings

**C. Man unwillingness**

1\. Matthew 23:37

*"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who
are sent to her! How often **I wanted to gather your children
together**, the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and **you
were unwilling**."*

Q. What did Christ wanted to do?

Q. Did it happen? Why not? ... They were unwilling

2\. John 5:39-40

*39 "You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have
eternal life; and it is these that bear witness of Me;*

*40 and **you are unwilling to come to Me, that you may have life**."*

**D. Man is held responsible for his belief in or rejection of
Christ** - John 3:18

1\. John 3:18

*"He who believes in Him is not judged; **he who does not believe has
been judged already**, because he has not believed in the name of the
only begotten Son of God."*

Q. What true of someone who that does not believe in Christ?

... He is judged already

2\. 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9

*8 "dealing out **retribution to those who do not know God** and to
those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.*

*9 And **these will pay the penalty of eternal destruction**, away from
the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power,"*

Q. Will man be held accountable for not obeying the gospel?

**E. God's sovereignty and man's responsibility - side by side**

1\. Judas betrayal of Christ - Luke 22:22

*"For indeed, the Son of Man is going as it has been determined; but
**woe to that man by whom He is betrayed**!"*

2\. John 6:37

*"All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me, and the one who comes
to Me I will certainly not cast out."*

**V. Man's Part in Salvation**

**A. Exercising our God Given Faith**

1\. The only thing a person can do that will have any part in salvation
is to exercise faith in what Jesus Christ has done for Him.

(*The MacArthur N.T. Commentary, Ephesians*, John MacArthur, Jr., page
61)

2\. But faith is a gift of God - received by man - EXAMPLE

"We act by the **faith** supplied by God's **grace**. That supreme act
of human faith, the act which, though it is ours, is primarily God's -
His **gift** to us out of His **grace**.

When a person chokes or drowns and stops breathing, there is nothing he
can do. If he ever breathes again it will be because someone else starts
him breathing. A person who is spiritually dead cannot even make a
decision of faith unless God first breathes into him the breath of
spiritual life. **Faith** is simply breathing the breath that God's
grace supplies.

Yet the paradox is that we must exercise it and bear the responsibility
if we do not. (John 5:40)"

(*The MacArthur N.T. Commentary, Ephesians*, John MacArthur, Jr., page
61)

John 5:40, "*and you are unwilling to come to Me, that you may have
life.*"

**B. From Man's Point of View?** - Romans 10:9

1\. A brokenness over your sin - Luke 18:13 (LESSON 18:13)

'God, be merciful to **me, the <u>sinner</u>**!'"*

2\. A Confession of Christ as Lord - Romans 10:9

*"that if you **confess** with your mouth **Jesus as Lord**, and
**believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead**, you shall
be saved;*

**VI. Marks of a true believer:**

**A. Evidence of Salvation** (LESSON, pg. 45, III)

**1. Faith that Works** - James 2:14-18 (LESSON, III.A.1)

*14 "What use is it, my brethren, **if a man says he has faith, but he
has no works?** **Can that faith save him?***

*15 If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily
food,*

*16 and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, be warmed and be filled,"
and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use
is that?*

*17 **Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead**, being by itself.*

*18 But someone may well say, "You have faith, and I have works; show me
your faith without the works, and **I will show you my faith by my
works**."*

**2. Love that labors** - 1 John 4:7-8

*7 "Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God; and everyone
who loves is born of God and knows God.*

*8 **The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love**."*

**3. Hope that endures** - Titus 3:7

*"that being justified by His grace we might be made heirs according to
**the hope of eternal life**."*

Q. What is the hope of all Christians? ... Eternal life with Christ

Q. What is your hope?

**B. Application:**

⮚ Do I have a Faith marked by works

⮚ Do I love God and other Christians - marked by deeds

1\. Psalms 116:12-13 (LESSON, pg. 46, IV.B)

*12 "**What shall I render to the Lord For all His benefits toward
me?***

*13 I shall lift up the cup of salvation, And call upon the name of the
Lord."*

choice.**
