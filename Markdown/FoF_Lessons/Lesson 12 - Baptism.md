<u>The Importance of Believer's Baptism</u>

There are only two ordinances in the Christian Church - Baptism and the
Lord's Supper. Both are instituted in the Gospels, celebrated in the
Acts, and explained in the epistles. Since they are instituted in the
Gospels, and that by our Lord Himself, we may conclude that they are a
part of the message to us. Since they are celebrated in the Acts, we
conclude that they belong to the practice of Christ's church. Since they
are explained in the epistles, we conclude that they are designed to be
continued until Christ comes.

***I. Why Baptize?***

**A. The Lord's Command** – “Go therefore and make disciples of all the
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the
Holy Spirit” (Matthew 28:19). The word of our Lord is sufficient warrant
for baptism of Believers; no further authority is needed

**B. The Practice of the Early Church** - which gives the interpretation
put upon the Lord's words by those who heard him speak. We read
concerning the converts on the Day of Pentecost: “So then, those who had
received his word were baptized” (Acts 2:41). In Acts 8:26-39 we read of
Philip's preaching to the eunuch from Isaiah 33. As they went on their
way, the eunuch inquired if he might be baptized (v. 38). Further
examples of apostolic practice may be found in Acts 10:44-48; 16:31-33;
18:8.

***II. Who Should Be Baptized?***

**A. Disciples** - The evangelist was commanded to “make disciples of
all nations, baptizing them...” (Matthew 28:19).

**B. Believers** - “They that gladly received his word were baptized”
(Acts 2:41). The eunuch confessed his faith in Jesus Christ as the Son
of God, and then Philip baptized him (Acts 8:30-38). The jailor at
Philippi “was baptized, he and all his household, ... having believed in
God with his whole household.” (Acts 16:33-34).

**C. Those Who Have Received The Holy Spirit** - Peter was privileged to
preach the gospel to the Gentiles for the first time in history at
Cornelius' home. In Acts 10:44-48 we read, “While Peter was still
speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who were
listening to the message. … Then Peter answered, ‘Surely no one can
refuse the water for these to be baptized who have received the Holy
Spirit just as we did, can he?’ And he ordered them to be baptized in
the name of Jesus Christ.”

We conclude from Scripture, then that baptism is limited to disciples or
believers or those who have received the Holy Spirit - the different
designations for those who have personally received Jesus Christ as
Savior.

***III. What Does Baptism Mean?***

The answer to this important question is concisely stated in Romans
6:3,4: “Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into
Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death? Therefore, we have been
buried with Him through baptism into death, in order that as Christ was
raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might
walk in newness of life.” Therefore, baptism is a declaration of the
believer's identification with Christ in His death, burial and
resurrection. The apostle could say “I have been crucified with Christ”
(Galatians 2:20).

The believer's identification with Christ in His death is symbolized by
his going under the water “buried with Him through baptism into death.”
But the apostle Paul also speaks of our being “raised up with Christ”
(Col. 3:1). Our identification with Him in resurrection life is
symbolized by our coming up out of the water “that as Christ was raised
from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in
newness of life.”

But baptism is more than a declaration of the believer's identification
with Christ in His death, burial and resurrection. It is an
acknowledgement that our old self is dead, “that our old self was
crucified with Him, that our body of sin might be done away with, that
we should no longer be slaves to sin” and a profession that henceforth
we “might walk in newness of life” (Romans 6:6,4).

***IV. How shall We Baptize?***

A reference to a lexicon or to an English-Greek concordance reveals two
truths:

A. The word “baptism” is not a translation of an original Greek word,
but a transliteration, that is, bringing a word into another language
without changing or translating it. The original word is “baptizo.”

B. The lexicon meaning of “baptizo” is “to make whelmed, that is “fully
wet” “to dip”. It is evident that “baptizo” means to dip or immerse.

Why then was it not so translated? Sprinkling had already been
introduced in Britain and had been widely accepted. With so great a
public opinion in favor of sprinkling, the 1611 translators passed on
the responsibility by transliterating instead of translating. Instead of
doing a direct translation and using the word ‘immerse’, they created a
new word “baptism” transliterated from the Greek word, “baptizo.”

How necessary immersion is if the ordinance is to signify death, burial
and resurrection! When the believer goes into the water, death is
pictured; when he goes under the water, burial is pictured; when he
comes up out of the water, resurrection is pictured. But all this
symbolism is lost when sprinkling is practiced - the very meaning of the
ordinance is gone.

Moreover, the examples of baptism recorded in Scripture imply immersion
rather than sprinkling. “And after being baptized, Jesus went up
immediately from the water;” (Matthew 3:16). Why would He have ever
entered the Jordan if John were baptizing by sprinkling? Again we read,
“John also was baptizing in Aenon, near to Salim, because there was much
water there” (John 3:23). How unnecessary to seek out “much water” if
baptism were by sprinkling. Let one more reference suffice; “and they
both went down into the water, Philip as well as the eunuch; and he
baptized him” (Acts 8:38). How unnecessary to stop at “a certain water”
and to go down into it, in order to get a little water to sprinkle on
the eunuch's head.

All this seems conclusive to one who will bow to the authority of the
Word of God. The Lord commanded that those who believe in Himself should
be baptized. In doing this the believer publicly confesses his
identification with Christ in His death, His burial and His resurrection
and also professes that, henceforth, his walk will be in newness of
life. That the members that once served sin and Satan will now be
employed in the paths of righteousness and in the service of Christ.
Such a symbolic action can only be by immersion.

If you have trusted in Christ but have not yet confessed Him in baptism,
let me urge upon you the importance of obedience. For believers baptism
is not an option but a command.
