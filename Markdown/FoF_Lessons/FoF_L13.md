**Lesson \#13 - God’s Will and Guidance**


## I. GOD'S WILL DEFINED


⮚ God's sovereign will

⮚ God's will of desire

⮚ God's commanded will/ moral law

**A. God's sovereign will** (LESSON, section I, pg. 87)


#### 1. God's will of purpose - whatever He proposes to do will happen


a\. Isaiah 14:24 (LESSON, pg. 87, I.A.1.a)

*"The Lord of hosts has sworn saying, '**Surely, just as I have intended
so it has happened**, and just as I have planned so it will stand,'"*

b\. Isaiah 46:9-10 (LESSON, pg. 87, box @ bottom)

*9 "Remember the former things long past, For I am God, and there is no
other; I am God, and there is no one like Me,*

*10 Declaring the end from the beginning And from ancient times things
which have not been done, Saying, '**My purpose will be established, And
I will accomplish all My good pleasure**';"*

foreknowledge**

**a. Salvation - predestination** - Romans 8:29-30

*29 "For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to become conformed to
the image of His Son, that He might be the first-born among many
brethren;*

*30 and whom He predestined, these He also called; and whom He called,
these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also
glorified."*

**b. Predetermined plan of salvation** - Acts 2:22-23

*22 "Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus the Nazarene, a man
attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God
performed through Him in your midst, just as you yourselves know-*

*23 this Man, delivered up **by the predetermined plan and foreknowledge
of God**, you nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men and put Him
to death."*

**c. Governments - set up by God** - Romans 13:1

*"Let every person be in subjection to the governing authorities. For
established by God**."*

|                                                                          |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Note:** History is just watching God's plan in action from retrospect. |

**Question:**

Do we live our lives with the view that all that happens in history has
already been written by God?


### B. God's will of desire


**Note:** God's will of desire is consistent with His sovereign will -
but not always fulfilled.


#### 1. Jesus desired Jerusalem to be saved

*but what actually happened?*


Matthew 23:37

*"O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who
are sent to her! How often **I wanted to gather your children
together**, the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and **you
were unwilling**."*

⮚ The response of the people - John 1:11

*"He came to His own, and those who were His own did not receive Him."*

Note: Somehow God was limited by man's unwillingness.

Is this not true of salvation also.


#### 2. God desires all men to be saved

*I Timothy 2:3-4*


*3 "This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,*

*4 **who desires all men to be saved** and to come to the knowledge of
the truth."*


#### 3. Christ desired everyone to come to Him

*Matthew 11:28-29*


*28 "**Come to Me, _all_** who are weary and heavy-laden, and I
will give you rest.*

*29 "Take My yoke upon you, and learn from Me, for I am gentle and
humble in heart; and you shall find rest for your souls.*

**POINT: God calls.**

**People are unwilling to come.**


### C. God's commanded will/ or moral will


1. Seen in God's commands - i.e. the whole *New Testament*

2. A standard for man's behavior

3. (Lesson \#12 - OBEDIENCE)

4. Summed up in Matthew 22:37-40 (LESSON, I.B, pg. 88)

*37 "And He said to him, 'You shall love the Lord your God with all your
heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.'*

*38 "This is the great and foremost commandment.*

*39 "The second is like it, 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.*

*40 "On these two commandments depend the whole Law and the Prophets."*


## II. KNOWING GOD'S WILL


### A. Does God want us to know His will?


⮚ Can we know God's sovereign will? ... NO

⮚ Can we know God's commanded will? ... YES


#### 1. One can be filled with "the knowledge" of His will

*Colossians*

1:9

*"For this reason also, since the day we heard of it, we have not ceased
to pray for you and to ask **that you may be filled with the knowledge
of His will** in all _spiritual wisdom and understanding_,"*

\_ *Pleroo* (filled) - means to be completely filled, totally controlled

**Examples:**

⮚ Disciples' hearts were *filled* with sorrow when Jesus told them of
His departure (John 16:6)

⮚ Crowd was *filled* with fear after Jesus healed the paralytic (Luke
5:26)

⮚ The disciples were *filled* with the Holy Spirit (Acts 4:31)

⮚ Steven was *full* of faith (Acts 6:5)

**Note:** Each were totally under the control of what filled them.

(See: John MacArthur,*N.T. Commentary, Colossians & Philemon*, pg. 28)

**Point:** Paul wanted the Colossians to be totally controlled by
knowledge.

Are you totally controlled by the Word of God?


#### 2. We are to understand the Lord's will

*Ephesians 5:15-18 (memory*

verse 5:17)

*15 "Therefore **be careful how you walk**, not as unwise men, but as
wise,*

*16 **making the most of your time**, because the days are evil.*

*17 So then do not be foolish, but **_understand what the will of the
Lord is_**.*

*18 And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation, but **be
filled with the Spirit**,"*

Q. From verse 17, what are we to understand? ... what the will of the
Lord is

Q. How do we know what the will of the Lord is? ... His commands (above)

Q. What can we learn about God's will from these verses?

⮚ We are to make the most of our time.

How can we make the most of our time?


⮚ **We are to be filled with the Spirit.**

**B. How can we know His will?** (make a list on the board)

1. Be filled with the Spirit of God

2. Obedient to The Word of God – Scripture

3. Our desire must be one of willingness to seek God and to do His will

4. Have a desire to be Sanctified

5. Focus on things above

6. Seek wisdom

7. Seek Godly counsel


#### 1. Be filled with the Spirit of God


**Note:** "To **be filled with the Spirit** involves confession of sin,
surrender of will, intellect, body, time, talent, possessions, and
desires. It requires the death of selfishness and the slaying of
self-will."

*The MacArthur N.T. Commentary, Ephesians*, John MacArthur, Jr., pg


#### 2. Obedient to The Word of God - Scripture


**a. God's word is our guide** - Psalm 119:105 (LESSON, II.B.1, pg.

*"Thy word is a lamp to my feet, And **a light to my path**."*

**b. Given to us to obey** - Deuteronomy 29:29

*"The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but **the things
revealed belong to us and to our sons forever**, _that we may observe
**all** the words of this law_."*

**c. Adequate to equip us** - 2 Timothy 3:16-17

*16 "All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for
reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness;*

*17 **that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good
work.***"

**REMEMBER:** The Scriptures are the revealed will of God.

⮚ Promises

⮚ Commands

⮚ Warnings

⮚ Principles of life

To be ignorant of the Scriptures is contradictory to wanting to know
God's will.

filled with the Holy Spirit**

Note the following parallel passages:

Col. 3:16 and following (Being filled with the Scriptures)

Eph. 5:18 and following (Being filled with the Holy Spirit)

will**

**a. We need to be willing** - John 7:17

*"If **any man is willing** to do His will, **he shall know** of the
teaching, whether it is of God, or whether I speak from Myself."*

**b. A diligence to press on to know God** - Hosea 6:3

*"So let us know, **let us press on to know the Lord**. His going forth
is as certain as the dawn; And He will come to us like the rain, Like
the spring rain watering the earth."*

**c. Action - seeking God** - Psalm 27:7-8

*7 "Hear, O Lord, when **I cry with my voice**, And be gracious to me
and answer me.*

*8 When Thou didst say, '**Seek My face**,' _my heart_ said to
Thee, '**_Thy face, O Lord, I shall seek._**'"*

**d. Willing to give your life to God** - Romans 12:1-2

*1 "I urge you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to **present
your bodies a living and holy sacrifice**, acceptable to God, which is
your spiritual service of worship.*

*2 And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the
renewing of your mind, that you may prove what the will of God is, that
which is good and acceptable and perfect."*


#### 4. We must have a desire to be Sanctified


**a. It is God’s will that we be sanctified** – 1 Thessalonians 4:3

*“For this is the will of God, your sanctification; that is, that you
abstain from sexual immorality;”*

From this verse what clearly is God’s will for us?

… Sanctification (set apart, holy)

**b. We are commanded to be holy** – 1 Peter 1:16

*“because it is written, "You shall be holy, for I am holy."*

**c. Remember that sanctification is a work of God** – Philippians 1:6

*“For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work
in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.”*


#### 5. Our focus must be on things above


**a. Set your mind on things above** - Colossians 3:1-2

*1 "If then you have been raised up with Christ, **keep seeking the
things above**, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.*

*2 **Set your mind on the things above**, not on the things that are on
earth."*

**b. Seek God's kingdom** - as a first priority - Matthew 6:33

*"But **seek first His kingdom and His righteousness**; and all these
things shall be added to you."*

**c. Keep your eyes fixed on Christ** - Hebrews 12:1-2

*1 "Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding
us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance, and the sin which so easily
entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before
us,*

*2 **fixing our eyes on Jesus**, the author and perfecter of faith, who
for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and
has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God."*


#### 6. Seek wisdom


**a. Pray for wisdom** - James 1:5

*"But **if any of you lacks wisdom, _let him ask_ of God**, who
gives to all men generously and without reproach, and it will be given
to him."*

**b. The Scriptures lead to wisdom** - 2 Timothy 3:15

*"and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are
able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which
is in Christ Jesus."*

**7. Seek Godly counsel** (parallels LESSON II.B.4, pg. 93)

a\. Proverbs 1:5

*"A wise man will hear and increase in learning, And **a man of
understanding will acquire wise counsel**,"*

b\. Proverbs 11:14

*"Where there is no guidance, the people fall, But **in abundance of
counselors there is victory**."*

**THEN …**

If all of the above are in place then … Follow the desires of your
heart!

Psalms 37:4

*“Delight yourself in the Lord; And He will give you the desires of your
heart.”*

Q. What does God grant to those who are delighting in Him?

… the desires of their heart.
