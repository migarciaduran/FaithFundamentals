**Remember:**

⮚ If you don't have the Spirit - you are none of His - Romans 8:9,10.

⮚ You are sealed with the Holy Spirit

⮚ To dip or to sink

⮚ To be identified with

The word was used in 1 Corinthians 10:2, in relation to Moses:

*"and all were **baptized into Moses** in the cloud and in the sea;"*

This meant to:

⮚ To come under the leadership of Moses

⮚ To come under the Mosaic privileges and blessings

⮚ It was a new relationship


### B. Our relationship with Christ

*Romans 6:3-5*


*3 "Or do you not know that all of us **who have been baptized into
Christ Jesus** have been baptized into His death?*

*4 Therefore we have been buried with Him through baptism into death, in
order that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the
Father, so we too might walk in newness of life."*

*5 For if we have become united with Him in the likeness of His death,
certainly we shall be also in the likeness of His resurrection,"*

Note: We have been baptized into Christ

⮚ Dipped or immersed into Jesus Christ

⮚ United with Jesus Christ

⮚ Come under the leadership of Jesus Christ

⮚ To be put into the place of privilege and blessing from God.

*Galatians 3:26-27*


*26 "For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.*

*27 For all of you who were **baptized into Christ have clothed
yourselves with Christ**."*

**Note:** The changing of clothes = salvation - Isaiah 61:10

*"I will rejoice greatly in the Lord, My soul will exult in my God; For
**He has clothed me with garments of salvation**, He has wrapped me with
a robe of righteousness, As a bridegroom decks himself with a garland,
And as a bride adorns herself with her jewels."*


### D. Happens only once

*Ephesians 4:4-6*


*4 "There is one body and one Spirit, just as also you were called in
one hope of your calling;*

*5 one Lord, one faith, **one baptism**,*

*6 one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in
all."*

*17 And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord
Jesus, **giving thanks through Him to God the Father.***

*18 **Wives, be subject to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.**"*

**b. This concept is consistent with:**

\(1. Christ is the ***word*** - Revelation 19:13

*"And He is clothed with a robe dipped in blood; and **His name is
called _The Word of God_**."*

\(2. The Holy Spirit is equal to Christ ... this lesson.

\(3. Therefore: _Being filled with the Spirit is the same as being
filled with the Word_.

**Note:** "To **be filled with the Spirit** involves confession of sin,
surrender of will, intellect, body, time, talent, possessions, and
desires. It requires the death of selfishness and the slaying of
self-will."

*The MacArthur N.T. Commentary, Ephesians*, John MacArthur, Jr., pg

### B. Our strength


#### 1. The Holy Spirit - gives us the power to fulfill the Law

*Romans*

8:3-5

3 "For what the Law could not do, weak as it was through the flesh, God
did: sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and as an
offering for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh,

*4 in order that the requirement of **the Law might be fulfilled in us,
who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit**.*

*5 For those who are according to the flesh set their minds on the
things of the flesh, but those who are according to the Spirit, the
things of the Spirit."*
