Question: If God is omniscient then why pray?


### A. Introduction: Quotes on the purpose of prayer


#### 1. Unknown


"Prayer is the expression of man's dependence upon God for all things.
Prayer does not have the office of giving God information because God
foreknows all things. Rather, prayer discloses our faith in the
greatness of God and allows communion with God. Prayer brings us to our
knees before God in a humble unworthy spirit, praising Him, worshiping
Him and recognizing Him as the source of all things."

⮚ Prayer expresses our faith in God

⮚ Prayer expresses our submission to God by recognizing Him as God!

### B. David was discouraged

*Psalm 22:1-2 (Read, class as a whole)*


*1 "My God, my **God, why hast Thou forsaken me?*** ⮚ David is
discouraged

*Far from my deliverance are the words of my groaning.*

⮚ wonders why God

*2 O my God, I cry by day, but Thou doest not answer* does not answer

***and by night, but I have no rest.”***

And yet as the Psalm continues David, as he reflects upon God, has his
outlook changed to one of confidence and praise:

*O Thou who art enthroned upon the praises of Israel.*

*4 **In Thee our fathers trusted**;* ⮚ remembers God's

*They trusted, and Thou didst deliver them.* past faithfulness

***O Thou my help**, hasten to my assistance.*

*.*

*.*

*23 You who fear the Lord, **praise Him;*** ⮚ This moves him

*All you descendants of Jacob, **glorify Him**,* to praise

*And **stand in awe of Him**, all you descendants of Israel.*

to **pray and not to lose heart**,"*


### C. Sometimes it is different than what we ask for

*2 Corinthians*

*"And because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, for this
reason, to keep me from exalting myself, **there was given me a thorn in
the flesh**, a messenger of Satan to buffet me-- **to keep me from
exalting myself**!*

*8 Concerning this **I entreated the Lord three times that it might
depart from me**.*

*9 And **He has said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for power
is perfected in weakness**." Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast
about my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may dwell in me."*

Q. What was Paul asking the Lord for?


Q. How many times did he ask God to remove it?


Q. What was God's answer? ... No, depend on My grace.

Q. Why is this important?

## VII. How to Pray


### A. To whom do we pray?


#### 1. To God, through Christ

*Romans 1:8*


*"First, **I thank my God through Jesus Christ** for you all, because
your faith is being proclaimed throughout the whole world."*

Q. Who did Paul pray to?


Q. Why is it most likely the Father?


**2. To the Father; through Christ; in the Power of the Spirit** -
Ephesians 2:17-18

*17 "And He came and preached peace to you who were far away, and peace
to those who were near;*

*18 for **through Him we both have our access in one Spirit to the
Father**."*

Q. To whom do we have access to? (end of verse 18) ... *to the Father*

Q. Through whom is the access made possible? ... *Him* (must be Christ)

Q. How are we to pray? ... *in the Spirit*

⮚ Hebrews 10:19

*"Since therefore, brethren, we have confidence **to enter the holy
place by the blood of Jesus**,"*


#### 3. The Spirit intercedes for us

*Romans 8:26 (LESSON, pg. 53,*

I.A.2)

*"And in the same way the Spirit also helps our weakness; for **we do
not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for
us with groanings too deep for words**;"*

prayer***

1. Matthew 6:5-6

*5 "And **when you pray**, you are not to be as the hypocrites; for they
love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners, in
order to be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in
full.*

*6 But you, when you pray, **go into your inner room**, and when you
have shut your door, _pray to your Father_ who is **in secret**,
and your Father who sees in secret will repay you.*

Note the contrasts between verse 5 and 6:

Q. Who is praying in verse 5?


Q. How are they praying?


Q. Who is praying in verse 6?


Q. Who are we to pray to? ... the Father

Q. What the difference in the prayers being offered in verse 6, from
those of the hypocrites of verse 6?

⮚ Praying in secret - rather than - Praying in the open

⮚ God repays in secret - They have their reward already

a\. Have you ever been in a Bible study and they have group prayer?

You know that your turn to pray will be coming up?

Did you have thoughts like:

⮚ Will my prayer be religious enough?

⮚ What will I pray for?

**Note:** Don't pray if it is not from your heart.

Our prayers are to be heard by God and not other people.

b\. From verse 6, where should we go to pray?

⮚ Inner room

\- Small room, even a storage closet

\- Prayer is communion with God

\- Just you and God

⮚ Jesus regularly went away to pray on His own - Matthew 14:23

*"And after He had sent the multitudes away, **He went up to the
mountain by Himself to pray**; and when it was evening, He was there
alone."*

2. Matthew 6:7-8

*7 And when you are praying, **do not use meaningless repetition**, as
the Gentiles do, for they suppose that they will be heard for their many
words.*

*8 Therefore do not be like them; **for your Father knows what you need,
_before_ you ask Him**.*

Q. How are we not to pray? (verse 7)


Q. What do you think is meant by "meaningless repetition" - verse 7?

⮚ Not Persistence in prayer

The elect crying out the same thing - day and night - Luke 18:7

*"Now shall not God bring about justice for His elect, **who cry to Him
day and night**, and will He delay long over them?"*

⮚ How about repeating the same prayers before a meal?

Note the omniscience of God in verse 8 - but we are still to pray!

⮚ We show our dependence upon God & agreement with God in prayer.

⮚ Somehow the Father power is released through our prayers.


### C. Christ's Teaching on How to Pray:


**The Disciple's prayer is a model** - Matthew 6:9-13

*9 Pray, then, _in this way_: 'Our Father who art in heaven,
Hallowed be Thy name.*

*10 Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven.*

*11 Give us this day our daily bread.*

*12 And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.*

*13 And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For
Thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever. Amen.'"*


### C. The Disciples prayer is a model (continued)


**1. The prayer in "*this way*"** - verse 9a

a\. "*pray, then in this way:*"

Q. According to the beginning of verse 9, how are we to pray?


Q. What does *"in this way"* mean?

Does it say to "pray this ..."?


Q. What was the context of the prayer?

Look at Luke 11:1, the parallel passage.

b\. The disciples asked Jesus *_how_* to pray - Luke 11:1

*"And it came about that while He was praying in a certain place, after
He had finished, one of His disciples said to Him, "**Lord, teach us to
pray** just as John also taught his disciples."*


#### 2. *"Our Father"* (verse 9)


a\. Why *Our*?

Q. Who is the *Our*?


Q. Why is this important?

Church.


b\. Father

Q. What can we learn from "*Father*"?

\(1. Intimacy with God - end of fear - we are His children.

\(2. Sense of loneliness - is gone.

\(3. Respect; authority

\(4. Settles the matter of obedience.

\(5. Wants to provide for our needs - Luke 12:27-31

"*Consider the lilies of the field ..."*

Note: Other religions must appease their God.

Our Father has already been appeased through Christ.


#### 3. *Hallowed be Thy name* (verse 9b)


Q. What does *"Hallowed"* mean?

\(1. Holy - to set apart as sacred

\(2. Reverence - To lift on high!

Q. To a Jew, what did a person's name represent?


Q. So what is meant by *"Hallowed by Thy name"*?


Q. What other attributes can you think of to praise God?


⮚ Pray recounting His attributes

⮚ Reference lesson \#3, "God: His Character & Attributes"

Arthur Pink:


#### 4. *"Thy Kingdom come"* (verse 10a)


Q. Who kingdom? ... God's

Q. What is God's kingdom?


Q. How does one enter the kingdom? ... through conversion

Note: Christ preached the kingdom - Luke 4:43

*"But He said to them, 'I must preach the kingdom of God to the other
cities also, for I was sent for this purpose.'"*

Q. So what is Christ instructing us to pray for when He said to pray
"*Thy Kingdom come"*?


#### 4. *"Thy will be done"* (verse 10b)


Q. Your will? ... no Whose will? ... God's will

Q. What is God's will?


**Note:** _Again what would be important to Christ?_

⮚ Pray for God's will to be done - agreement with God

⮚ Pray that God's will, will become your will.

Q. What does the fact that Jesus tells us to pray, "*Thy will be done*"
indicate?


**Note:** "In God's wise and gracious plan, prayer is essential to the
proper working of His divine will on earth."

*The MacArthur N.T. Commentary, Matthew 1-7*, John MacArthur, Jr.,
pg


#### 5. *"Give us this day our daily bread"* (verse 11)


Q. What kind of statement is this? ... a petition

Q. What is the petition for? ... bread; needs; necessities

Q. What is the person praying recognizing?


Note: God wants us to asks him for our needs.

He wants to supply our needs.


#### 6. *"Forgive us our debts"* (verse 12)


Q. What are debts? ... sin (one of five N.T. terms for sin)

Q. What kind of prayer is this? ... a prayer of confession

⮚ Confession - I John 1:9

*"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our
sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."*

Q. Confessing our sin is sometimes difficult.

What normally fights against it?


⮚ Remember: Proverbs 28:13

*"He who conceals his transgressions will not prosper, But he who
confesses and forsakes them will find compassion."*

13)**

Q. Does this mean that we are to pray so that God will not tempt us?


*"Let no one say when he is tempted, 'I am being tempted by God'; for
God cannot be tempted by evil, and **He Himself does not tempt
anyone**."*

Q. What does it mean?


Note: Our desire is rather to submit to God - James 4:7

*"Submit therefore to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you."*

(verse 13b)**

Note: Not found in the most reliable manuscripts.

Sometimes in brackets or footnotes.

A doxology declaring the preeminence of God:

⮚ Triumph, exultation - recognition of God's power

⮚ Forever - hope
