Q. Who makes up the church - Go to LESSON, I.C

\_ Made up of the *<u>called out ones</u>*

a\. Colossians 3:15 - LESSON I.C.1

*"And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed **you
were called in one body**; and be thankful."*

b\. Baptized into one body - 1 Corinthians 12:13 - LESSON I.C.2

*"For **by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body**, whether Jews
or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one
Spirit."*

Q. How about all the denominations - Methodists, Baptists, etc.

Q. Which church should we attend?

These are questions we need to answer.

**B. The Believer's relationship to Christ and to Each other:**

**1. Family**

S a. Children of God - John 1:12

*"But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become
**children of God**, even to those who believe in His name,"*

S b. Brothers & Sisters - 1 Corinthians 7:15

*"Yet if the unbelieving one leaves, let him leave; **the brother or the
sister** is not under bondage in such cases, but God has called us to
peace."*

S c. Christ is our brother; God is our Father - Hebrews 2:11

*"For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from
one **Father**; for which reason **He is not ashamed to call them
<u>brethren</u>**,"*

Q. What relationships do we see in the above verses?

... We are children of God

... We are all brothers and sisters in Christ

... We have a Father

... i.e. we are a Family

Q. What does it mean to be a family?

<u>As a **Family:**</u>

Closeness of the family

Father son, daughter relationship

Care of the Father for the family

Provision of the Father for the family

The children's obedience to the Father

The honor of the family

**2. Flock of sheep**

S a. John 10:11

*"**I am the good shepherd**; the good shepherd lays down His life for
the **sheep**."*

S b. John 10:16

*"And I have other **sheep**, which are not of this fold; I must bring
them also, and they shall hear My voice; and they shall become **one
flock with one shepherd**."*

Q. Who is the Good Shepherd? ... Christ

Q. How are the believers represented? ... as sheep

Q. What relationship is true about a shepherd and his flock of sheep?

<u>As a **Flock of sheep**:</u>

The Shepherd gives guidance for the sheep.

The Shepherd cares for the sheep - or they would die.

(note: they cannot get up if they fall on their backs.)

The sheep are dependent upon the Shepherd.

The father calls His sheep - they know his voice.

S **3. Vineyard** - John 15:5

*"**I am the vine, you are the branches**; he who abides in Me, and I in
him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing."*

Q. Who is speaking here? ... Christ

Q. How is Christ represented and how are believers represented?

<u>As a **Vineyard:**</u>

We are to bear fruit.

As branches we are dependent upon the vine (roots).

We would die apart from the vine.

**4. Bridegroom & Bride**

S **a. Christ is pictured as the Bridegroom** - Mark 2:19-20

*19 "And Jesus said to them, 'While the **bridegroom** is with them, the
attendants of the bridegroom do not fast, do they? So long as they have
the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.*

*20 "But the days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them,
and then they will fast in that day.'"*

Q. Who is the bridegroom? ... Christ

S **b. The marriage of the lamb** - Revelation 19:9

**c. The Church is the Bride**

*"For I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy; for I betrothed you to
one husband, that **to Christ I might present you as a pure virgin**."*

S (2) Ephesians 5:25-27

(see 5:23 for context, *"For the husband is the head of the wife, as
Christ also is the head of the church ..."*

*25 Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and
gave Himself up for her;*

*26 that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of
water with the word,*

*27 that **He might present to Himself the church in all her glory**,
having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that **she should be
holy and blameless**."*

Q. As the Bride of Christ, what can we say about the Church?

... <u>As the **Bride of Christ:**</u>

S **a. Christ is the Head** - Ephesians 1:22,23

(LESSON I.A.1, pg. 59, uses Col. 1:18 and Eph. 5:23)

head over all things to **the church**,*

*23 **which is His body**, the fulness of Him who fills all in all.*

Q. How is the Church described? ... Christ's body

Q. What position does Christ hold? ... head

\* **b. We each have a different function** - Romans 12:4-6

*4 "For just as we have many members in one body and **all the members
do not have the same function**,*

*5 so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members
one of another.*

*6 And since **we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to
us, let each exercise them accordingly**: if prophecy, according to the
proportion of his faith;"*

Q. How is the body of Christ described?

Made up of many members (verse 4)

Each member has a different function (verse 4)

Q. Is each member the same?

... No each has a different gift

Q. What are we exhorted to do?

... exercise our gift

Q. What happens to a body if a member stops functioning?

... The body is crippled

Q. What are you currently doing in the Church?

**5. Body of Christ** (continued)

c\. 1 Corinthians 12:12-27 (here for completeness, only if needed)

*12 "For even as the **body is one and yet has many members**, and all
the members of the body, though they are many, are one body, so also is
Christ.*

*13 **For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews
or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one
Spirit**.*

*14 For the body is not one member, but many.*

*15 If the foot should say, 'Because I am not a hand, I am not a part of
the body,' it is not for this reason any the less a part of the body.*

*16 And if the ear should say, 'Because I am not an eye, I am not a part
of the body,' it is not for this reason any the less a part of the
body.*

*17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the
whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?*

*18 But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body,
just as He desired.*

*19 **And if they were all one member, where would the body be?***

*20 But now there are many members, but one body.*

*21 And the eye cannot say to the hand, 'I have no need of you'; or
again the head to the feet, 'I have no need of you.'*

*22 On the contrary, it is much truer that the members of the body which
seem to be weaker are necessary;*

*23 and those members of the body, which we deem less honorable, on
these we bestow more abundant honor, and our unseemly members come to
have more abundant seemliness,*

*24 whereas our seemly members have no need of it. But God has so
composed the body, giving more abundant honor to that member which
lacked,*

*25 that **there should be no division in the body, but that the members
should have the same care for one another**.*

*26 And if **one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if one
member is honored, all the members rejoice with it**.*

*27 Now **you are Christ's body**, and individually members of it."*

Q. How is the body of Christ described?

Made up of many members (verse 14)

Each member has a different function (verse 17 - also Rom. 12:4, below)

We have need of each other (verse 21)

Q. What if we do not carry out our function? ... the body will be
crippled.

Q. What are we exhorted to? ... unity (verse 25)

on rejoicing; so that also at the revelation of His glory, you may
rejoice with exultation."*

S b. Romans 8:16,17

*16 "The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are

S **c. Paul suffered** - Philippians 3:8-10

*8 "More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the
surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, **for whom I have

that I may gain Christ,*

*9 and may be found in Him, not having a righteousness of my own derived
from the Law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the
righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith,*
