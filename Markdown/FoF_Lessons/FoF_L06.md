### B. Foreknowledge & Predestination


#### 1. Chosen According to the Foreknowledge of God

*1 Peter 1:1,2*


*1 "Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who reside as aliens,
scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
**who are chosen***

*2 **according to the foreknowledge of God the Father**, by the
sanctifying work of the Spirit, that you may obey Jesus Christ and be
sprinkled with His blood: May grace and peace be yours in fullest
measure."*

Q. Who chose who? Did they choose God? ... no, God chose them.

Q. What was God's choice based on? ... His foreknowledge

Q. What is foreknowledge?


⮚ *Proginosko*

► *pro* – beforehand

► *ginosko* - to know in an _intimate way_

► Virgin - did not **know** (*ginosko*) her - Matthew 1:25

*"and kept her a **virgin** until she gave birth to a Son; and he called
His name Jesus."*

⮚ **Note:** God intimately foreknew us (a love relationship) -
**Forelove**

Q. What does it mean that God based His choice according to His
foreknowledge?

Q. Does this mean that God looked to the end of history to know who
would believe and then chose those persons to be saved?

**Predestination cannot be explained by God's Foreknowledge**

1. Many people try to resolve the predestination issue this way?

Q. Is this Biblical? ... No

2. Further problems with the "Foreknowledge on Predestination" view:

⮚ "If God based salvation on His advance knowledge of those who would
believe, where did their saving faith come from?"

Note: It could not come from their fallen nature.

They are blind and dead to the things of God

Review section I, above.

⮚ The Natural man does not accepts the things of God - 1 Corinthians
2:14

They are foolishness to him

*"But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God; for
they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they
are spiritually appraised."*


#### 2. Chosen According to the kind Intention of His will

*Ephesians*

1:4-5

*4 "just as **He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world**,
that we should be holy and blameless before Him. In love*

*5 **He predestined us** to adoption as sons through Jesus Christ to
Himself, **according to the kind intention of His will**,*"

Q. Again, who does the choosing? ... God

Q. Who is the "us"? ... believers

Q. When did He chose us?


Q. How long ago was that?


Q. Not only did He chose what else did God do?


⮚ **Predestination**

► To set the destiny of

► To be marked out, appointed or determined beforehand.

► To set the destiny of every person who will believe in Him.

Q. Why did He chose one over another?


Q. What does "*His will*" mean? ... He purposes to do it.


#### 3. According to God's purpose

*2 Timothy 1:9*


*"who has saved us, and **called us** with a holy calling, not according
to our works, but **according to His own purpose** and grace which was

## V. Man's Part in Salvation


### A. Exercising our God Given Faith


1. The only thing a person can do that will have any part in salvation
is to exercise faith in what Jesus Christ has done for Him.

(*The MacArthur N.T. Commentary, Ephesians*, John MacArthur, Jr., page
61)

2. But faith is a gift of God - received by man - EXAMPLE

"We act by the **faith** supplied by God's **grace**. That supreme act
of human faith, the act which, though it is ours, is primarily God's -
His **gift** to us out of His **grace**.

When a person chokes or drowns and stops breathing, there is nothing he
can do. If he ever breathes again it will be because someone else starts
him breathing. A person who is spiritually dead cannot even make a
decision of faith unless God first breathes into him the breath of
spiritual life. **Faith** is simply breathing the breath that God's
grace supplies.

Yet the paradox is that we must exercise it and bear the responsibility
if we do not. (John 5:40)"

(*The MacArthur N.T. Commentary, Ephesians*, John MacArthur, Jr., page
61)

John 5:40, "*and you are unwilling to come to Me, that you may have
life.*"


### B. From Man's Point of View?

*Romans 10:9*


1. A brokenness over your sin - Luke 18:13 (LESSON 18:13)

*"But the tax-gatherer, standing some distance away, was even unwilling
to lift up his eyes to heaven, but was **beating his breast**, saying,
'God, be merciful to **me, the _sinner_**!'"*

2. A Confession of Christ as Lord - Romans 10:9

*"that if you **confess** with your mouth **Jesus as Lord**, and
**believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead**, you shall
be saved;*


## VI. Marks of a true believer:


**A. Evidence of Salvation** (LESSON, pg. 45, III)


#### 1. Faith that Works

*James 2:14-18 (LESSON, III.A.1)*


*14 "What use is it, my brethren, **if a man says he has faith, but he
has no works?** **Can that faith save him?***

*15 If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily
food,*

*16 and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, be warmed and be filled,"
and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use
is that?*

*17 **Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead**, being by itself.*

*18 But someone may well say, "You have faith, and I have works; show me
your faith without the works, and **I will show you my faith by my
works**."*


#### 2. Love that labors

*1 John 4:7-8*


*7 "Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God; and everyone
who loves is born of God and knows God.*

many brethren;*

*30 and whom He predestined, these He also **called**; and whom He
called, these He also **justified**; and whom He justified, these He
also **glorified**."*

⮚ Whom He Foreknew

► He also Predestined

► He also Called

► He also Justified

► He also Glorified

Q. What is glorification? ... your new body; in heaven with God

principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,*
