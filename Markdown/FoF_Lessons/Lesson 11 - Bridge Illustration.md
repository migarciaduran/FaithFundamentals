# The Bridge Illustration

1\. Draw **Man** on one side of paper and **God** on the other, with **a
line** under each.

2\. State: God had a relationship with man when he was first created,
but something broke it.

Ask: Do you know what broke it? Some will guess it. You can state it.
**SIN**.

3\. Draw the gulf of **SIN** so that you now have the lines as shown on
the previous page with **Man**, **SIN**, and **God** as shown.

4\. Have them look up Romans 3:23 (or quote it to them).

What does this verse say about you and me? ... answer: we are both
sinners (you are on the same level as them.)

5\. Under the **Man** side, write out *"Romans 3:23 - all have sinned."*

6\. Have them look up Romans 6:23 (or quote it to them).

Ask them what wages are. They will answer ... something you earn or that
you get paid.

Point out that what you get paid for sin is death.

7\. Under the **Man** side, write out *"Romans 6:23 - the wages of sin
is death."*

Emphasize spiritual death ... man is dead to God.

8\. Have them look up Hebrews 9:27.

Point out that after a man dies he will face judgement.

9\. Under the **Man** side, write out *"Hebrews 9:27 - Judgement."*

You can even draw an arrow pointing down and write *"HELL."*

10\. Ask them how things look for man? ... not too good.

11\. Tell them that God knew man's situation and still desired to have a
relationship with him, so He sent His Son, Jesus Christ.

12\. Draw a bridge from the **Man** side to the **God** side.

An arrow pointing from **Man's** side to **God's** side.

Put the name **Jesus Christ** over the arrow or bridge.

13\. Write out one or two gospel verses under the arrow or bridge ... 1
Peter 3:18; Romans 5:8; 1 Peter 2:24; John 14:6.

Make the point that Jesus Christ died for our sins to bring us to God.

Also make the point that Jesus Christ is alive today.

14\. Now share with them 2 Corinthians 5:21. Make the point that Christ
took our sin and gave us His righteousness.

He took care of the sin issue (stated on the **Man** side).

15\. Under the **God** side, write out *"2 Corinthians 5:21 - Christ
took our sin, He gave us His righteousness."*

16\. Have them read John 5:24 (or quote it). Write *"John 5:24"* under
the **God** side.

Ask: What three things are promised in this verse? Write them out under
the **God** side, under *John 5:24*:

1). Write *"Eternal life"*

2). Write *"No judgement"*

3). Write *"Passed from death to life"*

17\. Point out how Christ took care of sin, death, and judgement stated
on the **Man** side.

18\. Ask: Which side are you on ... **Man's** side or **God's** side?

If they say **God's** side ask: How did you get there?

19\. If you get a works answer use Ephesians 2:8-9.

Write out at the bottom of the page - *"Ephesians 2:8-9 - Salvation is a
gift of God, you cannot earn it with your good works."*

20\. When they admit they are on **Man's** side, put an **X** on the
**Man** side.

21\. Read or share Romans 10:9-10.

Explain what Lord means ... sovereign God, whom they fall before as
master of their life.

Explain that this involves turning from their sin to Christ -
repentance.

22\. Write at the bottom of the page - *"Romans 10:9-10 - You must
receive Christ as your Lord."*

*"This involves turning from your sin to Christ."*

23\. Ask: Would you like to receive Christ as your Savior and Lord?
