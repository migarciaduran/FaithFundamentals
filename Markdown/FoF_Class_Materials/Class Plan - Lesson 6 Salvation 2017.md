FOF Lesson 6 – Salvation

# Prayer Requests

1.  Introduction

For the next three weeks, we will be studying salvation. Salvation can
refer to the time when a person repents of sin and accepts Christ as
Lord and Savior. It can also refer to the entire process starting in
eternity past covering the entire process by which a person is saved. We
will be looking at salvation doctrinally rather than simply as
repentance from sin and acceptance of Christ as Lord and Savior.

2.  Salvation

    1.  Man’s Condition Before Salvation – Review – ASK CLASS

> Ephesians 2:1-3 – **READ**

2.  Ways to Break Down Salvation

    1.  Three Parts – Salvation
        (conversion)/sanctification/glorification

    2.  Five Parts - Romans 8:29-30 –
        foreknew/predestined/called/justified/ glorified

> The key point to recognize in all of this is God’s sovereignty in
> salvation.
>
> <u>Romans 8:29-30</u> – For those *whom* **<u>He foreknew</u>**,
> **<u>*He also* predestined</u>** to become conformed to the image of
> His Son, so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren; and
> these *whom* He predestined, **<u>*He also* called</u>**; and these
> *whom* He called, **<u>*He also* justified</u>**; and these *whom* He
> justified, **<u>*He also* glorified</u>**.

What is the theme of this passage? – OPEN - the process of salvation and
God’s sovereignty over it.

What are the five links in salvation presented here? – WRITE ON BOARD

What is the tense of these verbs? – past

What does that mean? – it is as if it has already happened, even for
those not born

Who is whom? – the believer

What phrase is repeated four times? – “He also”

What is important about “He also”? – they are unbreakable links in a
chain

When does the process of salvation begin? – with God’s foreknowledge

When does it end? – never – eternal life; glorification

3.  Ten Parts – *Ordo Salutis* – election (foreknowledge and
    predestination)/ call/regeneration/conversion (repentance and
    faith)/justification/adoption/ sanctification/perseverance (eternal
    security)/death/glorification – WRITE ON BOARD – **observe how all
    fits together; parts refer to other parts**

<!-- -->

3.  *Ordo Salutis* – not necessarily in exact order; may be overlap;
    easier to study this way

    1.  Election (foreknowledge and predestination)

> <u>Romans 9:11-14</u> – for though **<u>the twins were not yet born
> and had not done anything good or bad, so that God’s purpose according
> to His choice would stand, not because of works</u>**, but because of
> Him who calls, it was said to her \[Rebekah\], “The older will serve
> the younger.” Just as it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I
> hated.” What shall we say then? **<u>There is no injustice with God,
> is there? May it never be!</u>**
>
> Paul is writing about election and using the illustration of Isaac’s
> children, one of whom was in the line of promise, one of whom was not.
> (**draw genealogy on board** – Abraham – Isaac/Ishmael – Jacob/Esau –
> Judah and other brothers)
>
> What shows that election is not based on anything in us? – God chose
> Jacob over Esau before they were born, **and** that the choice was not
> because of works

Is this unjust? – No. May it never be! Who are we to question God?
9:15-21.

> <u>2 Thessalonians 2:13</u> – But we should always give thanks to God
> for you, **<u>brethren beloved by the Lord, because God has chosen you
> from the beginning for salvation</u>** through sanctification by the
> Spirit and faith in the truth.

Who is Paul speaking to here? – brethren beloved by the Lord

What does Paul say about their salvation? – that God chose them from the
beginning for salvation

Does he say anything about works being involved in God’s choice? – No

Do we have anything to do with our salvation? – No, it is God’s
sovereign choice

> <u>1 Peter 1:1-2</u> – **<u>To those who reside as aliens</u>**,
> scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
> **<u>who are chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the
> Father</u>**, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit, to obey Jesus
> Christ and be sprinkled with His blood …
>
> What are we chosen according to? – God’s foreknowledge
>
> Does this mean that God knew who would believe and chose them? – No.
>
> Why not? – That would render Romans 9:11-14 a nullity, and it would
> contradict man’s depravity.
>
> What does foreknowledge mean? – it relates to people, not events
> (Romans 8:29 – “**whom** He foreknew”)
>
> How did He foreknow us? – because, by His own sovereign decree, He
> chose us, elected us
>
> <u>Ephesians 1:4-5</u> – just as **<u>He chose us in Him before the
> foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before
> Him. In love He predestined us to adoption as sons through Jesus
> Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of His will</u>**.

What did God do before the foundation of the world? – He chose us in Him

Why – for what purpose? – to be holy and blameless before Him

What else did God do? – He predestined us for adoption as sons through
Christ

What was the basis of His predestining us? – Love

<u>Acts 13:44-48</u> – The next Sabbath nearly the whole city assembled
to hear

> the word of the Lord. But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were
> filled
>
> with jealousy and began contradicting the things spoken by Paul, and
> were
>
> blaspheming. Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and said, "It was
> necessary
>
> that the word of God be spoken to you first; since you repudiate it
> and judge
>
> yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, **<u>we are turning to
> the Gentiles</u>**.
>
> "For so the Lord has commanded us, 'I HAVE PLACED YOU AS A LIGHT
>
> FOR THE GENTILES, THAT YOU MAY BRING SALVATION TO THE END
>
> OF THE EARTH.'" **<u>When the Gentiles heard this, they began
> rejoicing and</u>**
>
> **<u>glorifying the word of the Lord</u>**; and **<u>as many as had
> been appointed to eternal life believed</u>**.

Context – Paul and Barnabas preaching to the Gentiles

> What was the Gentiles response to the preaching? – rejoicing;
> glorifying the Word
>
> How many believed? – all who had been *appointed* to eternal life

Did anyone else believe, other than those appointed? – No.

Does it say they were appointed to eternal life because they believed? –
No.

> Was there any other condition for their belief? – No.
>
> So, their belief was a product of their being appointed to eternal
> life.

2.  Call

> <u>John 6:44</u> – **<u>No one can come to Me, unless the Father who
> sent Me draws him</u>**; and I will raise him up on the last day
>
> What must happen for a person to come to Christ? – the Father must
> draw him
>
> What does that mean? – OPEN – the Father puts a desire for Christ and
> heavenly things in our hearts so that we can come to Christ
>
> Why can’t we come on our own? – depravity; can’t understand spiritual
> things
>
> <u>2 Timothy 1:8-9</u> – Therefore, do not be ashamed of the testimony
> of our Lord or of me His prisoner, but join with me in suffering for
> the gospel according to the power of **<u>God, who saved us and called
> us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to
> His own purpose and grace which was granted us in Christ Jesus from
> all eternity</u>**.
>
> Who called us to salvation? – God
>
> Was it based on our works? – No
>
> What was the basis of our call? – God’s purpose and grace
>
> How long has it been God’s purpose to call us? – from all eternity

3.  Regeneration

> We cannot respond to God’s call until we are regenerated.
>
> <u>Ezekiel 36:24-27</u> – For I will take you from the nations, gather
> you from all the lands and bring you into your own land. Then I will
> sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you
> from all your filthiness and from all your idols. Moreover, **<u>I
> will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you</u>**; and I
> will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of
> flesh. **<u>I will put My Spirit within you</u>** and cause you to
> walk in My statutes and you will be careful to observe My ordinances.
>
> What is this a prophecy of? – the New Covenant
>
> What does God say He will do here? – cleanse us; give us a new
> heart/new spirit
>
> What will be the result in us? – we will have a heart to obey God
>
> Is there any indication that we have anything to do with this event? –
> No
>
> <u>John 3:1-5</u> – 1Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named
> Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews; 2 this man came to Jesus by night and
> said to Him, "Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher;
> for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him." 3
> Jesus answered and said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you,
> **<u>unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God</u>**."
> 4Nicodemus said to Him, "How can a man be born when he is old? He
> cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born, can
> he?" 5 Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, **<u>unless one is
> born of water and the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of
> God</u>**.
>
> What does Jesus say in v. 3? – No one can see the kingdom of God
> unless he is born again
>
> What, acc. to v. 5, does it mean to be born again? – born of water and
> the Spirit
>
> What does “born of water” symbolize? – cleansing – Ezekiel 36:25 (not
> baptism – no Scriptural support that baptism required for salvation;
> this would be a work)
>
> What does born of the Spirit mean? – the Spirit is the agent of
> cleansing, He replaces our hearts of stone with hearts of flesh.
>
> <u>Titus 3:5</u> – He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we
> have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy, **<u>by the
> washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit</u>**.
>
> Who saves us? – God
>
> Are we saved by works? – No
>
> What is our salvation according to? – God’s mercy
>
> How are we saved? – washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy
> Spirit
>
> <u>Note</u>: relate this back to Ezekiel 36 (that is what Jesus
> referred to in John 3:5)
>
> <u>1 Peter 1:23</u> – for you have been born again not of seed which
> is perishable but imperishable, that is, through the living and
> enduring word of God

How were we born again? – through the living and enduring word of God

How are we regenerated? – OPEN

> What is regeneration then? – “At the most fundamental level,
> regeneration is the divine impartation of eternal spiritual life into
> the spiritually dead sinner.” It is “a cleansing from sin and a
> creation of spiritual life. It is a purifying renovation.” (Biblical
> Doctrine, 580).

4.  Conversion (Repentance and faith)

> This is the result of the replacement of our hearts of stone with
> hearts of flesh that desire to obey the Lord.
>
> <u>Acts 20:21</u> – (Paul, to the elders in Ephesus) – solemnly
> testifying to both Jews and Greeks of **<u>repentance toward God and
> faith in our Lord Jesus Christ</u>**.
>
> What did Paul testify of? – repentance towards God; faith in Christ
>
> What does that mean? – turn towards God and trust in Christ
>
> Have you done those things?

1.  Repentance

> What is repentance? – OPEN
>
> It begins with conviction of sin by the Holy Spirit:
>
> <u>John 16:8-9</u> – And **<u>He, when He comes, will convict the
> world concerning sin</u>**, and righteousness, and judgment;
> concerning sin, **<u>because they do not believe in Me</u>**.
>
> Who is He? – the Holy Spirit
>
> What will He do? – convict the world of sin
>
> What sin? – unbelief
>
> Has the Holy Spirit convicted you of sin? Have you repented?
>
> <u>Example of Repentance</u>:
>
> David after his adultery with Bathsheba.
>
> <u>Psalm 51:1-4, 10-12</u> – Be gracious to me, O God, according to
> Your lovingkindness; according to the greatness of Your compassion
> blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and
> cleanse me from my sin. For I know my transgressions, and my sin is
> ever before me. Against You, You only, I have sinned and done what is
> evil in Your sight… 10 Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a
> steadfast spirit within me. Do not cast me away from Your presence and
> do not take Your Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of Your
> salvation and sustain me with a willing spirit.
>
> What attributes of God does David appeal to? – lovingkindness,
> compassion
>
> What does he ask God to do? – blot out his transgressions, wash him
> thoroughly of sin, cleanse him, create in him a new heart, renew him
> with a steadfast spirit, do not cast him out, restore to him the joy
> of salvation, give him a willing spirit.
>
> What does David acknowledge about himself? – his sin
>
> Who does David say his sin is against? – God
>
> What does that mean about repentance? – we are to acknowledge that our
> sin has offended God – it is not about the consequences in our own
> life
>
> This example is not related to conversion – David was already a
> believer. But, it well illustrates what repentance is.
>
> I would ask you to read through and compare 2 Corinthians 7:9-10 and
> Hebrews 12:15-17 to learn more about the “sorrow” aspect of repentance

2.  Faith – see HANDOUT re Quiz Question 10

> More than mere intellectual assent to or agreement with facts about
> Jesus.
>
> <u>James 2:19</u> – You believe that God is one. You do well; **<u>the
> demons also believe and shudder</u>**.
>
> Who believes facts about Christ? – demons
>
> Are demons saved? – No
>
> <u>Acts 26:27-28</u> – King Agrippa, **<u>do you believe the prophets?
> I know that you do</u>**. Agrippa replied to Paul, “**<u>In a short
> time you will persuade me to become a Christian</u>**.”
>
> Does Agrippa believe the prophets? – yes
>
> Was he a Christian? – No
>
> <u>John 3:16</u> – God so loved the world that He sent His only
> begotten Son, that whoever **<u>believes in Him</u>** shall not perish
> but have eternal life.
>
> What must we do to obtain eternal life? – believe *in* Christ
>
> What does it mean to believe in Christ? – OPEN
>
> Do you believe in Christ?
>
> <u>Ephesians 2:8-9</u> – For by grace **<u>you have been saved through
> faith</u>**; and that not of yourselves, **<u>it is the gift of
> God</u>**; not as a result of works, so that no one can boast.
>
> We have looked at this passage before - The only thing we are called
> to do is to exercise faith in what Christ has done for us, the faith
> being supplied by God in His grace <u>as a gift</u>

3.  Salvation requires repentance and submission to Christ as Lord

> <u>Isaiah 55:6-7</u> – **<u>\[s\]eek the Lord</u>** while He may be
> found; **<u>call upon Him</u>** while He is near. **<u>Let the wicked
> forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts; and let him
> return to the Lord</u>**, and He will have compassion on Him, and to
> our God, for He will abundantly pardon.

What are we called to do to receive the Lord’s compassion and pardon? –
seek Him, call upon Him, forsake our wicked ways and unrighteous
thoughts, return to Him

What does it mean to “forsake” something? – give it up forever; repent

Have you sought, called upon, and returned to the Lord?

Have you forsaken your wicked ways and thoughts?

> <u>John 3:36</u> – He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he
> who does not **<u>obey the Son</u>** will not see life, but the wrath
> of God abides on him.
>
> What is required for eternal life? – believing in Christ
>
> Who will not see life, but wrath? – those who do not obey Christ
>
> What does “obey” imply re: our position relative to Christ’s? –
> submission
>
> What does this mean is required for salvation? – submitting to Christ
>
> Have you submitted your life to Christ?

5.  Justification

> The great doctrine of justification by faith alone is what led to the
> split of the church into Catholic and Protestant. This reformation in
> the early 1500’s was led by Martin Luther, a devout Catholic monk who
> after desperately seeking peace with God through works, who had his
> eyes opened to the truth that justification is by grace alone by faith
> alone, and not by works.
>
> What does it mean to be justified? – OPEN – declared not guilty
>
> <u>Romans 4:3</u> – For what does the Scripture say? “**<u>Abraham
> believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness</u>**.”
>
> What did Abraham’s belief in God result in for him? – righteousness
>
> What does it mean that it “was credited” to him? – imputed, reckoned,
> given
>
> <u>Galatians 2:16</u> – nevertheless knowing that **<u>a man is not
> justified by the works of the Law, but through faith in Christ
> Jesus</u>**, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we may be
> **<u>justified by faith in Christ</u>** and not by the works of the
> Law; since by the works of the Law no flesh will be justified.
>
> Are we justified by works of the Law? – no
>
> What is Paul referring to when he says “The Law”? – the OT laws
>
> How are we justified? – through faith in Christ
>
> <u>Romans 5:1</u> –Therefore, **<u>having been justified by faith, we
> have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ</u>**.
>
> What do we have as a result of being justified by faith? – peace with
> God
>
> <u>Romans 8:1</u> – Therefore, **<u>there is now no condemnation for
> those who are in Christ Jesus</u>**.
>
> What will those of us who are justified by faith in Christ avoid? –
> condemnation
>
> Justification is a not guilty verdict from God given to us at the
> moment we believe

6.  Adoption

> <u>Romans 8:14-17</u> – **<u>For all who are bring led by the Spirit
> of God, these are sons of God</u>**. For you have not received a
> spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but **<u>you have received a
> spirit of adoption as sons</u>** by which we cry out, “Abba! Father!”
> The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of
> God, and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow heirs with
> Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him so that we may also be glorified
> with Him.
>
> Where is the Holy Spirit? – indwelling believers
>
> For those being led by the Spirit, what or who are we? – sons of God
>
> What have we received? – a spirit of adoption as sons
>
> The Holy Spirit testifies with our spirit what? – that we are children
> of God
>
> <u>Ephesians 1:5</u> - **<u>He predestined us to adoption as sons
> through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the kind intention of
> His will</u>**.
>
> What did God *predestine* believers to? – Adoption as sons
>
> What is the basis for this predestining to adoption? – kind intention
> of God’s will

7.  Sanctification

> What is sanctification? - OPEN
>
> <u>1 Thessalonians 4:3</u> – For this is the will of God, your
> sanctification
>
> What is God’s will? – that believers be sanctified
>
> <u>Philippians 2:12-13</u> – **<u>work out your salvation with fear
> and trembling</u>**; for it is God who is at work in you, both to will
> and to work for His good pleasure.

This describes the process of sanctification.

What are we responsible for? – working out our salvation with fear and
trembling

What does it mean to “work out our salvation”? – work at it, exert
energy at it

What is the evidence of conversion? – fruit, good works

> What does “fear and trembling” mean? – a healthy fear of offending God
> and a reverence for Him
>
> What is God’s part? – He is working in us, strengthening us,
> energizing us, to do good works, things that please God
>
> Are you working out your salvation with fear and trembling? – ASK
> PEOPLE
>
> How do we work out our salvation? – practicing the Means of Grace
> (Scripture, Prayer, Fellowship, Providence, Obedience).
>
> <u>Resource</u>: “Sanctification: The Christian’s Pursuit of God-Given
> Holiness” by Mike Riccardi.

8.  Perseverance/Eternal Security

> We cannot lose our salvation.
>
> Use David as illustration – sin with Bathsheba, killed her husband,
> bad father – yet, He was called a man after God’s own heart. Acts
> 13:22.
>
> <u>Romans 8:29-30</u> – refer back to it and indicate that God sees
> our salvation all the way from election in eternity past to final
> glorification and eternal life
>
> <u>Philippians 1:6</u> – For I am confident of this very thing, that
> **<u>He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of
> Christ Jesus</u>**.
>
> What was Paul confident of? – that God would finish the work He
> started
>
> What does this mean (in the big picture of salvation)? - OPEN
>
> <u>1 Peter 1:3-5</u> – Blessed by the God and Father of our Lord Jesus
> Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born
> again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from
> the dead, **<u>to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and
> undefiled and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you, who are
> protected by the power of God through faith for a salvation ready to
> be revealed in the last time</u>**.

What is awaiting believers in heaven? – an inheritance reserved for us
that is imperishable and undefiled and everlasting

> What does that mean about our faith and the promise of eternal life? –
> we cannot lose it
>
> What protects our faith? – God’s power
>
> <u>Romans 8:38-39</u> – For I am convinced that neither death, nor
> life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things
> to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created
> thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in
> Christ Jesus our Lord.
>
> What is Paul convinced of? – *nothing* can separate believers from the
> love of God

Do you believe that you can lose your salvation?

> Have you ever struggled so much that you thought that God left you?
>
> We are secure *forever* in Christ.

9.  Death

> <u>2 Corinthians 5:8</u> – we are of good courage, **<u>I say, and
> prefer rather to be absent from the body and to be at home with the
> Lord</u>**.
>
> How should believers view death? – a blessing; we get to go home to
> the Lord
>
> <u>2 Timothy 4:6-7</u> – For I am already being poured out as a drink
> offering, and the time of my departure has come. **<u>I have fought
> the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the
> faith</u>**.

What was Paul’s epitaph as he faced death? - I have fought the good
fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith

> If you were to die today, could you say that?

10. Glorification

> <u>Romans 8:30</u> - and these whom He predestined, He also called;
> and these whom He called, He also justified; and these whom He
> justified, **<u>He also glorified</u>**
>
> What is God’s promise to believers? – we will be glorified
>
> What does it mean to be glorified? – resurrection body, in heaven with
> God
>
> Read Revelation 21 and 22 for a glimpse of what heaven will be like.

Do you see the sovereignty of God in our salvation? – He elects us, He
draws us, He changes our hearts, He gives us the faith to believe, His
power protects our salvation, and He glorifies us.

3.  Man’s Responsibility in Salvation

There are a number of Scriptures that evidence God’s will about
salvation, and the fact that the call to salvation is open to the world.
John 3:16 is an example of this.

1.  God desires all to be saved and has issued an open call to the world

> JUST READ THESE
>
> <u>2 Peter 3:9</u> – The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some
> count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing for any to
> perish but for all to come to repentance.
>
> <u>1 Timothy 2:3-4</u> – This is good and acceptable in the sight of
> God our Savior, who desires all men to be saved and come to the
> knowledge of the truth.
>
> <u>John 3:16</u> – For God so loved the world that He gave His only
> begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have
> eternal life.
>
> <u>Romans 10:13</u> – for whoever will call upon the name of the Lord
> will be saved.

But, notwithstanding election, and the fact that faith is a free gift
from God, <u>man is responsible</u> for his belief in, or rejection of,
Christ. This should not be troubling because Scripture extensively
presents both God’s sovereignty in salvation, as well as man’s
responsibility, with no apparent issue among the writers of the Word.
*We have to be willing to come to Christ* – <u>Matthew 11:28-29</u>
(“Come to Me, all who are weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you
rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me”).

2.  Man is unwilling to believe

> <u>Matthew 23:37</u> – O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets
> and stones those who are sent to her! **<u>How often I wanted to
> gather your children together</u>**, the way a hen gathers her chicks
> under her wings, and **<u>you were unwilling</u>**.
>
> What did Christ want to do with the Jews in Jerusalem? – gather them
> to Himself
>
> What is His emotional state? – sadness, lament (O Jerusalem,
> Jerusalem)
>
> Why was He sad? – they were unwilling to receive Him
>
> Remember what David asked for in Psalm 51:12? – a willing spirit
>
> <u>John 5:39-40</u> – You search the Scriptures, because you think
> that in them you have eternal life; and it is these that bear witness
> of Me; and **<u>you are unwilling to come to Me, that you may have
> life</u>**.
>
> What were the people doing to whom Jesus spoke? – searching the
> Scriptures
>
> For what? – how to enter the kingdom
>
> What were they unwilling to do? – come to Christ
>
> In this context, what does Jesus’ reference to the Jewish religious
> leaders’ unwillingness to come to Him imply about what our response to
> Jesus should be? – we have to be willing to come to Him; there must be
> an open, willing, humble response; like the faith of the children in
> Matthew 18:3-4.

3.  Man Is Held Responsible for Rejection or Belief in Christ

> <u>2 Thessalonians 1:8-9</u> – dealing out **<u>retribution to those
> who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our
> Lord Jesus</u>**. These will pay the **<u>penalty of eternal
> destruction, away from the presence of the Lord</u>** and from the
> glory of His power
>
> Who will receive retribution and eternal destruction and separation
> from God? – those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel
>
> Are criminals sentenced for something they did not do or are not
> responsible for? – No
>
> What does that say about our response to the gospel? – we are
> responsible; man is judged for failing to believe the gospel.
>
> Do you know God? Do you obey the gospel of Christ?
>
> This is life and death – refer them to John 3:1-21.
>
> For anyone who has yet to come to Christ, are you willing to believe
> in Him?

4.  Marks of a True Believer (not nearly an exhaustive list)

    1.  Love for God

> <u>Mark 12:28-32</u> – 28 One of the scribes came and heard them
> arguing, and recognizing that He had answered them well, asked Him,

3.  Good Works/Fruit

> <u>James 2:14-18</u> – What use is it, my brethren, if someone says he
> has faith but he has no works? Can that faith save him? If a brother
> or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food, and one of
> you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and be filled,” and yet you
> do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use is that?
> **<u>Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead, being by
> itself</u>**. But someone may well say, “You have faith and I have
> works; show me your faith without the works, and **<u>I will show you
> my faith by my works</u>**.
>
> What is dead faith? – faith without works
>

4.  Pattern of Obedience in Our Lives

<u>1 John 2:3-4</u> - By this **<u>we know that we have come to know
Him, if we keep His commandments</u>**. The one who says, “I have come
to know Him,” and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the
truth is not in him.

How does John say that we show that we know Christ? – obedience

What are we to think if someone claims to know Christ but is not
obedient? – he is a liar

Does this mean perfect obedience? – No. It should be the pattern of our
lives

<u>1 John 1:10</u> – **<u>If we say that we have not sinned, we make Him
a liar</u>** and His word is not in us.

How do we make God a liar? – by claiming we have not sinned

5.  Hunger for the Word

> <u>1 Peter 2:2</u> – like newborn babies, **<u>long for the pure milk
> of the word</u>**, so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation.
>
> What are we to long for? – the word
>
> What does it mean to “long for”? – crave, desire
>
> Do you crave the word? How often are you in the word?
>
> What is the benefit of craving the word? – spiritual growth;
> sanctification

5.  Our Response

If we are believers – thank God for His grace freely bestowed on us;
worship and praise Him

If we are not believers – God is waiting for you to make your choice.

<u>2 Corinthians 6:2</u> – At the acceptable time, I listened to you,
and on the day of salvation I helped you. **<u>Behold, now is the
acceptable time, behold, now is the day of salvation</u>**.
