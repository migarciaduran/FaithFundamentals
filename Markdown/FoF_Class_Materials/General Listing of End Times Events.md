End Times – General Sequence of Events

Obviously, much more can be said, and other Scriptures can be added.
And, we do not want to turn the end times simply into a calendar. That
said, here is the general order of events that we hold to here at Grace
Community Church, based on a pre-tribulational, pre-millennial view of
eschatology.

Rapture – 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18; 1 Corinthians 15:51-52; John 14:1-3;
Acts 1:11.

- No indication of when this will take place; a “sign-less event”

- Dead believers rise from the dead, and meet Christ in the air, then
  living believers have their bodies transformed to glorified bodies in
  the twinkling of an eye and meet Christ in the air.

- They will be with Jesus forever (1 Thess. 4:17)

- Taken with Christ to heaven for duration of tribulation period – bema
  seat judgment of rewards (1 Corinthians 3:11-14; 2 Corinthians 5:10)
  and marriage supper of the Lamb (Revelation 19:1-10)

Tribulation (7 years) – Daniel 9:24-27; Matthew 24:4-28; Revelation 6-18
(note – the tribulation can be divided into two 3 ½ year/42 month
periods – the tribulation and the “great tribulation” – separated by the
“abomination of desolation” in Matthew 24:15).

- Unveiling of God’s wrath on unbelievers in concentrated judgments of
  increasing intensity.

- People will come to faith (and die for their faith) during the
  tribulation (Revelation 6:9-11)

- Some believers will survive the tribulation.

Jesus’ Return/Second Coming – Matthew 24:29-51; Matthew 25:31; 2
Thessalonians 1:7-10; Titus 2:13; John 14:3; Revelation 19:11-16.

Judgment/Separation of Sheep and Goats – Matthew 25:31-46

- Sheep – believers 🡪 will be part of the millennial kingdom (yes, some
  folks will enter the kingdom in “normal,” earthly bodies)

- Goats – unbelievers 🡪 likely held in Hades pending final judgment

Millennial Kingdom (on earth for 1000 years; for believers) – Revelation
20:1-10

- Many OT passages address (e.g., Ezekiel 40-48; Amos 9:11-15; Joel
  3:18)

- There will be children born during the kingdom and death at 100 years
  old will seem like the death of a child (Isaiah 65:20)

- Because children will be born in the kingdom, there will eventually be
  unbelievers in the millennial kingdom, who will join in Satan’s final
  rebellion, which will be crushed.

End of Millennial Kingdom (culminating in Great White Throne judgment) –
Revelation 20:11-15

- Great White Throne judgment is for unbelievers only; is final; results
  in Lake of Fire.

Uncreation/Destruction of Present Heavens and Earth – 2 Peter 3:10

Creation of New Heavens and New Earth – Revelation 21-22; Isaiah 65:17

- Where believers will dwell forever with the Lord.

There is much more that could be said!
