FOF Lessons 12 & 13 – Obedience and God’s Will – Part 1

1.  Introduction

We have come to the last portion of the class. We have looked at the
Bible as a whole, at God and His attributes, the person and work of
Jesus Christ, salvation, and the Holy Spirit. After that, we looked at
more practical aspects of the Christian life including prayer, worship,
fellowship, spiritual giftedness, and evangelism, in our effort to equip
you to live a blessed/fruitful Christian life. In these last two
lessons, we will look at the issue of obedience and God’s will. As
believers, we are called to obedience, which we will see as we work
through these lessons.

2.  What is Obedience?

> What is obedience? – OPEN – following the commands of God in the Bible

1.  Obedience is not just a list of dos and don’ts

> <u>Colossians 2:20-23</u> – **<u>If you have died with Christ to the
> elementary principles of the world</u>**, **<u>why</u>**, as if you
> were living in the world, **<u>do you submit yourself to decrees such
> as, “Do not handle, do not taste, do not touch!”</u>** (which all
> refer to things destined to perish with use) – **<u>in accordance with
> the commandments and teachings of men</u>**? **<u>These are matters
> which have, to be sure, the appearance of wisdom in self-made religion
> and self-abasement and severe treatment of the body, but are of no
> value against fleshly indulgence</u>**.
>
> Who is Paul addressing in this passage? – believers (“if you have died
> with Christ…”)
>
> What is his command to believers? – do not submit yourselves to
> decrees of men
>
> What kind of decrees are these? – dos and don’ts relating to
> perishable, earthly things
>
> What do such regulations have the appearance of? – wisdom
>
> Are these from God? – no, it is self-made religion
>
> What are such man-made regulations valueless against? – fleshly
> indulgence

2.  Obedience is a heart issue

> <u>Psalm 40:8</u> – I delight to do Your will, O my God; Your law is
> **<u>within my heart</u>**.
>
> What is David’s delight? – to do God’s will
>
> Why is that his delight? – because God’s law is in his heart
>
> <u>Ephesians 6:5-6</u> – **<u>Slaves, be obedient</u>** to those who
> are your masters according to the flesh, **<u>with fear and
> trembling</u>**, **<u>in the sincerity of your heart</u>**, **<u>as to
> Christ</u>**; not by way of eyeservice as men-pleasers, **<u>but as
> slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart</u>**.

This passage refers to employer-employee relationships, but what phrase
in this passage tells us that it is of more general application? – “as
to Christ”

What are we commanded to do with our employers, and to Christ? – be
obedient

What should our attitude be as we obey? – fear, trembling

How should we obey? – in the sincerity of our hearts/from the heart

What does “in the sincerity of your hearts” mean? – with a true desire
to obey, not just to curry favor from our superiors.

Do you obey grudgingly, or is it your heart’s desire? (Matthew 21:28-32
– doing is better than saying)

3.  Obedience is about denying self

> <u>Luke 9:23</u> – If anyone wishes to come after Me, he must
> **<u>deny himself</u>**, and take up his cross daily and follow Me.

To be a follower of Christ, what must we do? – deny ourselves, take up
our cross daily, and follow Christ

> What does it mean to deny ourselves? – to surrender our wills, our
> desires, to God
>
> What does it mean to follow Christ? – to imitate Him; to do what He
> did

4.  Obedience is about offering ourselves to God

> <u>Romans 12:1</u> – Therefore, I **<u>urge</u>** you brethren, by the
> mercies of God, to **<u>present your bodies a living and holy
> sacrifice, acceptable to God</u>**.

<u>Context</u> – After discussing salvation for 11 chapters, Paul
launches into his practical exhortations to believers as a result of
their justification by faith.

> What is his command? – present your bodies as a living and holy
> sacrifice to God
>
> Is this a mere suggestion? – no, he is urging us
>
> What is a living and holy sacrifice of our bodies? – using all of our
> resources, talents, abilities, and gifts in a manner that serves and
> pleases God.
>
> So, obedience is not simply dos and don’ts, but a heart issue where we
> truly desire to obey God, to deny ourselves, take up our cross, and
> follow Christ. It is about sacrificing our own desires to serve God
> with a willing heart.

5.  Obedience is about personal holiness

> <u>1 Peter 1:16</u> – You shall be holy, for I am holy.
>
> What is holiness? – it the crowning jewel of all of God’s perfections
> – His set apart-ness; His perfect moral righteousness – we are called
> to the same.

3.  Why do we need to be obedient?

    1.  We are called to love God

> <u>Mark 12:28-31</u> – One of the scribes came and heard them arguing,
> and recognizing that He had answered them well, asked Him, “**<u>What
> commandment is the foremost of all</u>**?” Jesus answered, “The
> foremost is, Hear O Israel! The Lord our God is one Lord; and **<u>you
> shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your
> soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength</u>**. The
> second is this, you shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no
> other commandment greater than these.”
>
> According to Jesus, what is the greatest commandment? – to love God
> with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength.
>
> What is the second greatest commandment? – to love our neighbors as
> ourselves

2.  We show our love to God by keeping His commandments

> <u>John 14:15</u> – If you love Me, you will **<u>keep My
> commandments</u>**. (John 14:21, 23)
>
> How do we show our love to Christ? – by keeping His commandments
>
> What is another word for keeping His commandments? - obedience
>
> <u>2 John 6a</u> – And this is love, that we **<u>walk according to
> His commandments</u>**.

What is love? – keeping God’s commandments

So, how do we show our love to God? – by keeping His
commandments/obeying Him.

3.  Scripture commands obedience of believers

> <u>Ecclesiastes 12:13</u> – The conclusion, when all has been heard
> is: **<u>fear God and keep His commandments</u>**, because this
> applies to **<u>every person</u>**.
>
> Who wrote Ecclesiastes? – Solomon
>
> What trait is Solomon known for? – wisdom
>
> After surveying his life and experiencing everything life had to
> offer, what was Solomon’s conclusion about life? – fear God and keep
> His commandments
>
> Who does this command apply to? – every person
>
> Why? – it is God’s basis for life from His inspired, inerrant Word,
> and it is God’s basis for judgment (the “books” for unbelievers;
> rewards for believers).
>
> So, we need to be obedient because we are commanded to love God, and
> we show our love for God by keeping His commandments as the desire of
> our hearts.
>
> What is your heart attitude about obedience? Is it a list of external
> dos and don’ts, or is it your heart’s true desire to obey, honor, and
> glorify God based on His Word?

4.  How do we know what to obey? How do we know what God’s Will is?

    1.  Different Aspects of God’s Will

        1.  <u>God’s Sovereign/Decreed Will</u> – whatever God purposes
            will happen

> <u>Isaiah 14:24</u> – The Lord of hosts has sworn, saying, “Surely,
> **<u>just as I have intended so it has happened, and just as I have
> planned so it will stand</u>**.”
>
> If God decrees or intends something to happen, what is the result? –
> it will happen
>
> <u>Acts 2:22-23</u> – Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus the
> Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and
> signs which God performed through Him in your midst, just as you
> yourselves know – this man, delivered up **<u>by the predetermined
> plan and foreknowledge of God</u>**, you nailed to a cross by the
> hands of godless men and put Him to death.
>
> Was Jesus death on the cross something pulled together at the last
> moment? – No.
>
> What was it according to? – God’s predetermined plan and foreknowledge
>
> So, God planned Christ’s redemptive death from before the foundation
> of the world, and it happened!!

2.  <u>God’s Will of Desire</u> – consistent with His sovereign will;
    not always fulfilled

> We are familiar with 1 Timothy 2:3-4 and 2 Peter 3:9. READ THEM.
> **BUT**…
>
> <u>Matthew 23:37</u> – O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets
> and stones those sent to her! **<u>How often I wanted to gather your
> children together</u>**, the way a hen gathers her chicks under her
> wings, and **<u>you were unwilling</u>**.
>
> What did Jesus want for the Jews? – salvation in Him
>
> Were they willing to receive Him? – no
>
> So, God *desires* men to be saved, but He has not *decreed* all men to
> be saved.

3.  <u>God’s Commanded or Moral Will</u> – seen in God’s commands to us

    1.  Standards for our behavior – all over NT

    2.  We looked at this in Mark 12:28-31, which sums this up

> And, we are commanded to understand and be filled with God’s will –
> Eph. 5:17 (understand what the will of the Lord is); Col. 1:9 (be
> filled with the knowledge of His will, with a view towards applying
> it).

2.  Read and Study Scripture noting its Commands – the Scriptures are
    the revealed will of God, and ignorance of them contradicts the
    command to know God’s will

> <u>Psalm 119:105</u> – Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to
> my path
>
> What does this text say about the word of God? – it directs our paths
> and shows us where we are to walk
>
> Where should we look to find out what God’s will is for us? – in the
> Scriptures
>
> Do you look to Scripture to understand what God’s will is for you?
>
> <u>Psalm 119:11</u> – Your word I have treasured in my heart, that I
> may not sin against you.
>
> Why does the psalmist treasure God’s word in his heart? – so he will
> not sin against God
>
> What is sin, in the context of our lesson? – disobedience towards God
>
> If the psalmist treasures the word in his heart so that he does not
> sin, what does that mean we should be doing? – the same
>
> How do we do about that? – read, study, meditate on the word, hear it
> preached
>
> <u>James 1:22-25</u> – But **<u>prove yourselves doers of the word,
> and not merely hearers who delude themselves</u>**. For is anyone is a
> hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks at his
> natural face in the mirror; for once he has looked at himself and gone
> away, he has immediately forgotten what kind of person he was.
> **<u>But one who looks intently at the perfect law, the law of
> liberty, and abides by it, not having become a forgetful hearer but an
> effectual doer, this man will be blessed in what he does</u>**.
>
> Is it sufficient to merely hear the word? – no
>
> What are those who merely hear the word and do not do what it says? –
> they are deluded
>
> What should our response be after looking intently at the word? –
> abide in it
>
> What does that mean “abide”? – to live in it; to do it
>
> What is the result for a doer of the word? – blessing.
