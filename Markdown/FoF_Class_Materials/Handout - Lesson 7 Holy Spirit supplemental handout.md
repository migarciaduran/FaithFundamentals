2.  Deity of the Holy Spirit

    1.  Attributes

        1.  Omniscience

> <u>Isaiah 40:13-14</u> – **<u>Who has directed</u>** the Spirit of the
> Lord, or as His counselor has <u>informed</u> Him? **<u>With whom did
> He consult</u>** and **<u>who gave Him understanding</u>**? And
> **<u>who taught Him</u>** in the path of justice and taught Him
> knowledge and informed Him of the way of understanding?
>
> The text contains rhetorical questions.
>
> What is a rhetorical question?
>
> What is the answer to each of the rhetorical questions here?
>
> What portion of the passage illustrates the Spirit’s sovereignty?
>
> What portion of the passage illustrates the Spirit’s omniscience?

2.  Omnipresence

> <u>Psalm 139:7</u> – Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I
> flee Your presence?
>
> Can we flee or hide from God’s Spirit?
>
> What attribute does this illustrate?

3.  Eternality

> <u>Hebrews 9:14</u> – how much more will the blood of Christ, who
> through **<u>the eternal Spirit</u>** offered Himself without blemish
> to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living
> God?
>
> What adjective is used of the Spirit here?
>
> What does that say about His existence?

4.  Truth

> <u>1 John 5:6</u> – This is the One who came by water and blood, Jesus
> Christ; not with the water only, but with the water and the blood. It
> is the Spirit who testifies, because **<u>the Spirit is the
> truth</u>**.
>
> What is the Spirit?
>
> What does that mean for believers, who have the Spirit in them?
>
> Do you always follow that truth?

5.  Holiness

> Simply the name.
>
> So, the Spirit is omniscient, omnipresent, eternal, truth, and holy

2.  Statements of Deity

> <u>2 Corinthians 3:17</u> – Now **<u>the Lord is the Spirit</u>**, and
> where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
>

    1.  Truth

> <u>1 John 5:6</u> - **<u>the Spirit is the truth</u>**

> will deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, and has
> regarded as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was
> sanctified, and has insulted the **<u>Spirit of grace</u>**?
>
> What name is given to the Holy Spirit here?

3.  Work and Ministry of the Holy Spirit

    1.  Creation

> <u>Genesis 1:1-2</u> – **<u>In the beginning</u>** God created the
> heavens and the earth. The earth was formless and void, and darkness
> was over the surface of the deep, and **<u>the Spirit of God was
> moving over the surface of the waters</u>**.
>
> What is the context here?
>
> When was this taking place?
>
> What was the Spirit of God doing?
>
> What does this say about the Spirit as far as creation goes?

2.  Christ’s Birth

> <u>Luke 1:35</u> – The angel answered her and said to her, “The Holy
> Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will
> overshadow you; and for that reason the holy Child shall be called the
> Son of God.
>
> <u>Context</u> – angel is telling Mary, a virgin, that she will have a
> child
>
> How does Mary become pregnant?
>
> Who will the child be?
>
> So, the Holy Spirit was involved in Christ’s conception and birth

3.  Giving of God’s Word

> <u>2 Peter 1:20-21</u> – But know this first of all, that no prophecy
> of Scripture is a matter of one’s own interpretation, **<u>for no
> prophecy was ever made by an act of human will</u>**, **<u>but men
> moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God</u>**.
>
> What does the words “prophecy of Scripture” mean? Is it merely
> foretelling of future events found in Scripture?
>
> Do Scriptural truths come from the human will?
>
> Where do they come from?
>
> What does it mean “men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God”?
>
> So, the Holy Spirit was the agent in the giving of God’s word.

4.  Active in Salvation (additional to what we covered in class)

    1.  Indwells the Believer

> <u>1 Corinthians 6:19</u> – Or do you not know that **<u>your body is
> a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you</u>**, whom you have from
> God, and that you are not your own?
>
> Context – Paul is admonishing the Corinthian believers about sexual
> immorality
>
> Who is Paul writing to here?
>
> What does Paul say about their bodies?
>
> Where is the Holy Spirit?
>
> What do you think Paul signifies by using the word “temple”?
>
> So, what do you think Paul’s position about sexual immorality is?
>
> What does it mean that “you are not your own”?
>
> Do you realize that your body is a temple of the holy spirit of God
> and that you are not your own?
>
> Realizing that, how might your actions change?

2.  Seals the Believer

> <u>Ephesians 1:13-14</u> – In Him, you also, after listening to the
> message of truth, the gospel of your salvation – having also believed,
> **<u>you were sealed in Him with the Holy Spirit of promise</u>**,
> **<u>who is given as a pledge of our inheritance</u>**, with a view to
> the redemption of God’s own possession, to the praise of His glory.
>
> Who is Him?
>
> What is the message of truth?
>
> What has to happen before we believe?
>
> Once we believe, what happens?
>
> Sealed in who? Sealed by who?
>
> What does it mean that the Holy Spirit is given as a pledge of our
> inheritance? What does “pledge” mean?
>
> What is the ultimate object for which the Holy Spirit is a down
> payment?

3.  Teaches

> <u>1 Corinthians 2:12-14</u> – Now we have received, not the spirit of
> the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the
> things freely given to us by God, which things we also speak, not in
> words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit,
> combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words. But a natural man
> does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are
> foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are
> spiritually appraised.
>
> Who have believers received?
>
> What is the purpose (“so that” clause) of our receiving Him?
>
> Who teaches us the things given to us by God?
>
> Can the natural man understand such things?
>
> What must happen before the natural man can believe?
>
> Isn’t that awesome! – when you are thinking, meditating on the word,
> and have a realization about what God has given you, that is the Holy
> Spirit teaching you.

4.  Sanctifies

> <u>2 Thessalonians 2:13</u> – But we should always give thanks to God
> for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God has chosen you from
> the beginning for **<u>salvation</u>** through **<u>sanctification by
> the Spirit</u>** and faith in the truth.
>
> What aspect of salvation is referred to here?
>
> What are the steps to final glorification?
>
> Who is the agent of our sanctification?
>
> Do we have any role in our sanctification (Philippians 2:12-13)
