Lesson 5 – HANDOUT (useful quotes re: atonement and the resurrection of
Jesus Christ)

<u>Miguel Nuñez (from High King of Heaven, p. 89)</u> – “We need the
forgiveness of God, certainly, but we also need the life of Christ. We
need the cross, but we also need the resurrection because we were dead
in sins and transgressions. Apart from Christ, there is no resurrection,
and if there is no resurrection, there is neither life nor gospel. And
if there is no gospel, there is no hope. It’s incredible that Jesus gave
us life by dying. His death is the only death that gives life. I cannot
be born again spiritually without His death.”

<u>Bruce Ware (from The Man Christ Jesus – Theological Reflections on
the Humanity of Christ, Ch. 7 excerpts)</u> – “The atoning death of
Christ was only efficacious because Jesus who died for our sins was a
full and integral human being. Now granted, he had to be more than
merely a man to die for our sins. To be sure, he had to be the God-man
for the atonement to be efficacious. But while he had to be more than a
mere man, he could not have been less than fully a man.”

“So now the question is this: how do we, as humans, pay for our sin if
we are required to pay it ourselves? We pay for it eternally. That is,
we never finish paying for our sin, because our sin requires an infinite
payment. The reason that hell is eternal is simply that justice demand a
full payment for our sin, and a full payment is impossible for finite
humans to render to an infinitely holy God. Therefore, if we pay for our
own sin, we pay forever, and hence there never comes a time when we can
say, ‘It is finished!’”

“We need a human substitute, to be sure. But we need a human whose
payment for sin is of infinite value. Therefore, the only one who can
save us from our sin is the sinless God-man – one who is fully man, as
we are, but one is fully God, so that his payment for our sin can
satisfy the infinite demands of God’s justice against our sins.”

“Therefore, Jesus has to be fully God as well as fully man. He had to be
fully God for the payment he rendered to be of infinite value,
satisfying the demands of an infinitely holy God against our sin. But he
also had to be fully human in order for his death to be substitutionary,
strictly speaking. … So although the infinite value of Christ’s payment
for our sin attaches to his being fully God, the substitutionary nature
of Christ’s death – that he took our place, bore our sin, and died the
death we deserved to die – attaches most squarely to his being fully
human.”

“The Father actually charges his own Son with our sin and guilt in order
that he might pay for them and secure for us the forgiveness and
righteous standing that we then receive by faith. This is the heart of
the gospel, and it is the heart of the work of Christ on the cross.”

“Christ has to be human in order for this imputation of our sin to take
place. If he were divine only, it is inconceivable and impossible that
our sin would be imputed to him. How could his eternal sinless and holy
nature take on sin? … No, the divine nature cannot be tarnished with
sin, and certainly as God (only), Jesus could not have been ‘made sin.’
But the Father *did* make him to be sin, and he did bear our sin in his
body on the cross. Clearly, then, the imputation of our sin to Christ
has in mind his full and perfect humanity that was, at the moment of
that imputation, made what it never had been before – sin.”
