> and that Moses should tell the Israelites that I AM sent Moses.

What is God’s self-given name? – I AM

#### Incarnation

What is the Incarnation? – God becoming flesh; God becoming a human
being

The Incarnation begins with the virgin birth of Christ

<u>Luke 1:26-35</u> – 26 Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was
sent from God to a city in Galilee called Nazareth, 27 to a virgin
engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the descendants of David; and
the virgin's name was Mary. 28 And coming in, he said to her,
"Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you." 29 But she was very
perplexed at this statement, and kept pondering what kind of salutation
this was. 30 The angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary; for you
have found favor with God. 31 "**<u>And behold, you will conceive in
your womb and bear a son, and you shall name Him Jesus</u>**. 32 "He
will be great and **<u>will be called the Son of the Most High; and the
Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David</u>**; 33 and He
will reign over the house of Jacob **<u>forever</u>**, and His kingdom
will have no end." 34 Mary said to the angel, "How can this be, since I
am a virgin?" 35 The angel answered and said to her, "The Holy Spirit
will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you;
and for that reason the holy Child shall be called the Son of God.

<u>Context</u> – angel Gabriel announcing to Mary, a young Jewish girl,
that she will conceive a child

What does the angel say Joseph and Mary SHALL name the child? - Jesus

What will He be called? – the Son of the Most High

What will God give Him? – the throne of His father David

What does it mean that David is called “His father”? – Jesus is in the
genealogical line of David.

Why is that important? – fulfillment of OT prophecies regarding the
Messiah.

How long will he reign? – forever

#### Kenosis – Philippians 2

So far, we have had a taste of Christ’s deity – we will look at it more
later on – but, keep the fact that Christ is God in your minds as we
discuss kenosis.

Kenosis refers to Jesus’ voluntary relinquishing of the independent
exercise of His divine attributes while He lived on earth.

What we hope to learn is: (1) that Jesus did not relinquish His
essential deity during His Incarnation; (2) that Jesus used His divine
attributes on earth; and, (3) that Jesus is fully human

To get at this point, we will look at why Paul used the kenosis
illustration in Philippians 2.

### 

## What is Kenosis?

> Comes from Greek word *kenoō* (ke-nah-oh), which means “to empty”

## What is the purpose of the text in Philippians 2 where kenosis is referenced?

> <u>Philippians 2:3-8</u> – “Do nothing from selfishness or empty
> conceit, but with humility of mind regard one another as more
> important than yourselves; do not merely look out for your own
> personal interests, but also for the interests of others. Have this
> attitude in yourselves which was also in **<u>Christ Jesus, who,
> although He existed in the form of God, did not regard equality with
> God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a
> bond-servant, and being made in the likeness of men. Being found in
> appearance as a man</u>**, **<u>He humbled Himself</u>** by becoming
> obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.”
>
> What was Paul’s point that he was trying to convey to the Philippians?
> (v. 3-4)
>
> “Do nothing from **<u>selfishness</u>** or **<u>empty conceit</u>**,
> but with **<u>humility</u>** of mind **<u>regard one another as more
> important than yourselves</u>**; do not merely look out for your own
> personal interests, but also for the interests of others.”
>
> What attitudes was Paul admonishing the Philippians to avoid? –
> selfishness, empty conceit
>
> What are the attitudes that Paul wanted to see in the Philippians? –
> humility, putting others’ interests above their own

*Who* did Paul use to illustrate his point? – Christ

> Let’s look at how Jesus illustrated Paul’s point:

1.  In what form did Jesus exist? (v. 6) – in the form of God

2.  What language connects this passage to the Incarnation? – “being
    made in the likeness of men”

> What is man’s likeness? – physical limitations, no omniscience, SIN
>
> <u>Romans 8:3</u> – God sent “His own Son **<u>in the likeness of
> sinful flesh</u>** as an offering for sin.”
>
> What form did Jesus take on in His Incarnation? – a bondservant
>
> What is a bondservant? – *doulos* – slave; one who gives himself up to
> another's will; one who is devoted to another to the disregard of
> one’s own interests

3.  *During His Incarnation* to whom did Jesus not regard Himself as
    equal? (v.6) – God

4.  As part of His Incarnation, what did Jesus do? – He emptied Himself

5.  What are some of the things Jesus emptied Himself of?

    1.  Jesus temporarily gave up the worship and glory He received in
        Heaven as God to be mistreated, to suffer, and to die

> <u>John 17:1, 5</u> – “Jesus … lifting up His eyes to heaven, said,
> ‘Father, the hour has come; **<u>glorify Your Son</u>**, that the Son
> may glorify You,’ … (v.5) Now, Father, **<u>glorify Me together with
> Yourself, with the glory which I had with You before the world
> was</u>**.’”
>
> What is Jesus doing here? – praying
>
> What does He pray for? – that He would be returned to the glory He had
> with the Father before the world was
>
> When did He have this glory? – before the world was
>
> What is the meaning of the fact that He was praying to be returned to
> the glory He once had? – that He gave His glory up when He came to
> earth
>
> What attribute of Jesus is on display here? – humility – He gave up
> His glory to come to earth and suffer on our behalf
>
> What does this exhort us to do? – be willing to give up things in our
> lives when someone else will benefit

2.  He temporarily gave up His independent divine authority

> <u>John 6:38</u> – “’For I have come down from heaven, **<u>not to do
> My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me</u>**.’”
>
> What did Jesus surrender when He came to earth? – His will
>
> Whose will did He follow? – “Him who sent Me” – the Father’s will
>
> What kind of example is that for our lives? – we must surrender our
> will and follow God’s will
>
> What attribute of Jesus is depicted here? – humility; illustration of
> the setting aside of the independent use of His
> volitition/intentionality

3.  He temporarily gave up the independent use of His divine attributes

> <u>Matthew 24:35-36</u> – “’Heaven and earth will pass away, but My
> words will not pass away. **<u>But of that day and hour no one
> knows</u>**, not even the angels of heaven, **<u>nor the Son, but the
> Father alone</u>**’”
>
> Context – Jesus is preaching a sermon referred to as the Olivet
> Discourse. The sermon is primarily about the end times and Jesus’
> second coming.
>
> What does Jesus say will happen to the heavens and earth? – pass away
>
> Who does Jesus say does not know when that event will happen? – Jesus,
> man, heavenly angels.
>
> Who does know? – the Father alone
>
> What attribute of Jesus is restricted here? – omniscience
>
> What should we think about groups such as the Jehovah’s Witnesses who
> repeatedly attempt to predict when Jesus will return?

4.  He temporarily gave up His intimate relationship with His Father

> <u>Matthew 27:46</u> – “About the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a
> loud voice, saying, ‘ELI, ELI, LAMA SABACHTHANI?’ that is, ‘**<u>MY
> GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME</u>**?’”
>
> Where was Jesus? – On the cross
>
> (*contrast* with John 1:1-2) – In the beginning was the Word, and the
> Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with
> God.
>
> Do you see how Jesus’ relationship with the Father changed on the
> Cross?
>
> Was Jesus permanently forsaken? – No.
>
> Where is He now? – at the right hand of the Father

6.  Did Jesus cease to be God during His Incarnation? – No – EXAMPLES?

# He performed miracles and healed people 

> <u>Matthew 8:14-15</u> – “When Jesus came into Peter’s house, He saw
> his mother-in-law lying sick in bed with a fever. **<u>He touched her
> hand, and the fever left her</u>**; and she got up and waited on Him.”
>
> Where was Jesus? – Peter’s house
>
> Who was in Peter’s house? – Peter’s mother-in-law
>
> What was she doing? – lying in bed with a fever
>
> What did Jesus do? – He touched her and healed her
>
> How did He heal her? – touch
>
> How quickly was she healed? – immediately
>
> What attributes of Christ does this show? – power, mercy, grace
>
> <u>John 11:43-44</u> – raising Lazarus from the dead.

# He forgave sins

> <u>Matthew 9:6-7</u> – “’But so that you may know that **<u>the Son of
> Man has authority on earth to forgive sins</u>**’ – then He said to
> the paralytic, ‘Get up, pick up your bed and go home.’ And he got up
> and went home.”
>
> Who is speaking? – the Son of Man, Jesus
>
> What does He claim He has authority to do? – forgive sins
>
> How did He prove that He had this authority? – healing the paralytic
>
> By claiming this authority, what else was Jesus claiming? – to be God
>
> How does your heart react to the fact that <u>only</u> God can forgive
> your sins?

# He claimed to be God - We looked at this before with John 8:58.

> <u>John 10:30</u> – I and the Father are one.
>
> What is Jesus saying here in terms of whether He set aside His deity
> when He came to earth? – He did not set it aside.

7.  What attributes are the focus in Philippians 2:8? – humility,
    obedience

> What does it mean to humble ourselves? – acknowledge our limitations,
> inferiority, ***submission***, lowliness, servitude
>
> What is obedience? – doing God’s will
>
> How far did Jesus take His obedience (v. 8)? – death on the cross
>
> So what does this tell us about how we should live? - Our obedience
> and submission to Christ must be to the point of death – <u>total
> commitment</u>

8.  So, Christ is **<u>the</u>** illustration of the humility that Paul
    was exhorting the Philippians to demonstrate in their lives.

9.  Ultimately, kenosis refers to the humility, or lowering, of Jesus
    Christ in His Incarnation.

#### Transfiguration

<u>Matthew 17:1-8</u> – 1 Six days later **<u>Jesus took with Him Peter
and James and John his brother, and led them up on a high mountain by
themselves</u>**. 2 And **<u>He was transfigured before them</u>**; and
**<u>His face shone like the sun</u>**, and **<u>His garments became as
white as light</u>**. 3 And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them,
talking with Him. 4 Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be
here; if You wish, I will make three tabernacles here, one for You, and
one for Moses, and one for Elijah." 5 While he was still speaking, a
bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud
said, "This is My beloved Son, with whom I am well-pleased; listen to
Him!" 6 When the disciples heard this, they fell face down to the ground
and were terrified. 7 And Jesus came to them and touched them and said,
"Get up, and do not be afraid." 8 And lifting up their eyes, they saw no
one except Jesus Himself alone.

What does Transfiguration mean? – changing of figure or form

Who did Jesus take with him up on the mountain? – Peter, James, John

Peter referred to this event as the “eyewitness of His majesty” – 2
Peter 1:16

What was Jesus’ appearance like during the Transfiguration? – shining
like the sun, garments white as light

What did the Father say? – This is My beloved Son with whom I am
well-pleased; *listen to Him*

What does that mean we should do? – listen to Christ

Are you listening to Christ? – OPEN

What is the importance of the Transfiguration? – it shows us Christ’s
deity while He was on earth; He pulled back the veil of His humanity;
revealed His true glory to Peter, James, and John, as a preview of the
glory He would have when He returns at His second coming. The event was
mainly to assure the disciples of His return in glory after His death,
resurrection, and ascension.

Jesus temporarily re-assumed the glory He voluntarily gave up when He
came to earth, or temporarily previewed the glory he would re-assume
after He went back into heaven.

#### Jesus Christ is God – we looked at this in John 8:58 already

## The Bible Refers to Jesus Christ as God

> <u>John 1:1,14</u> – **<u>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word
> was with God, and the Word was God</u>**. … **<u>And the Word became
> flesh, and dwelt among us</u>**, and we saw His glory, glory as of the
> only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.
>
> v\. 14 – Who is the Word? – Christ, the only begotten of the Father
>
> From when did He exist? – since the beginning
>
> What verse does John 1:1 bring to mind? – Genesis 1:1
>
> Where was Christ in the beginning? – with God
>
> Who does these verses say that the Word, Jesus Christ, is? - God
>
> <u>Colossians 2:9</u> – **<u>For in Him all the fullness of Deity
> dwells in bodily form</u>**.
>
> In whom does the fullness of Deity dwell? – Christ
>
> How much of Deity dwells in Him? – all the fullness of it
>
> In what form of Christ does the fullness of Deity dwell? – His bodily
> form
>
> Who does that mean He was while on earth? – God
>
> Do you see Christ, in His humanity, as God also? – OPEN.
>
> He is fully God and fully man.

## Jesus Christ was crucified because He claimed to be God

> <u>Matthew 26:63-66</u> – But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest
> said to Him, “I adjure You by the living God, that You **<u>tell us
> whether You are the Christ, the Son of God</u>**? Jesus said to him,
> “You have said it yourself; nevertheless I tell you, hereafter you
> will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming
> on the clouds of heaven.” Then the high priest tore his robes and
> said, “He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses?
> Behold, your have now heard the blasphemy; what do you think?” They
> answered, “He deserves death!”

What does “Christ” mean? – Messiah; Anointed One.

What did the high priest order Jesus to do? – say whether He was the
Messiah

What was Jesus’s answer, essentially? – yes

What was the high priest’s reaction? – that Jesus was a blasphemer

What did the crowd say? – He deserved death

#### Christ’s Attributes – we discussed some of these earlier

## Eternality

> <u>Revelation 22:12-13</u> – Behold, I am coming quickly, and My
> reward is with Me, to render to every man according to what he has
> done. **<u>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the
> beginning and the end</u>**.
>
> Who is speaking here? - Christ
>
> How does Christ refer to Himself? – Alpha and Omega, first and last,
> beginning and end
>
> What does that say about Christ? – He is eternal

## Omnipotence

1.  Power over Nature

> <u>Matthew 8:23-27</u> – 23 When He got into the boat, His disciples
> followed Him. 24 And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so
> that the boat was being covered with the waves; but Jesus Himself was
> asleep. 25 And they came to Him and woke Him, saying, "Save us, Lord;
> we are perishing!" 26 He said to them, "Why are you afraid, you men of
> little faith?" Then **<u>He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea,
> and it became perfectly calm</u>**. 27 The men were amazed, and said,
> "What kind of a man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey
> Him?"

What was the context here? – sudden storm on the sea; Jesus asleep

When the storm kicked up, what was the disciples’ response? – fear

What did Jesus do? – told the storm to subside – rebuked the winds and
the sea

What happened? – the storm and its effects subsided

What attribute of Jesus does this demonstrate? – power

2.  Power over Disease – Jesus healed a lot of people – e.g. Luke
    4:33-36

3.  Power over Demons – Jesus cast out a lot of demons – e.g., Mark
    5:1-20.

## Omniscience 

> <u>John 2:23-25</u> – “Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover,
> during the feast, many believed in His name, observing His signs which
> He was doing. But Jesus, on His part, was not entrusting Himself to
> them, for **<u>He knew all men</u>**, and because He did not need
> anyone to testify concerning man, for **<u>He Himself knew what was in
> man</u>**.”
>
> What does this say Jesus knew? – what was in man
>
> Did anyone have to tell Him about man or what was in man? – No
>
> What does this indicate about Jesus? – that He knew everything

## Holiness

> <u>Acts 3:14-15</u> – But **<u>you disowned the Holy and Righteous
> One</u>** and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, but put to
> death the Prince of life, the one whom God raised from the dead, a
> fact to which we are witnesses
>
> <u>Context</u> – Peter was preaching a sermon to Jews at the Temple in
> Jerusalem
>
> How does Peter refer to Jesus here? – the Holy and Righteous One
>
> What is holiness? – separate; moral perfection, absolute purity,
> untainted by sin.
>
> <u>2 Corinthians 5:21</u> – **<u>He made Him who knew no sin to be sin
> on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God in
> Him</u>**

How much sin did Christ have? – none

How did God use Christ? – He made Him sin; He put our sin on Christ

Why? – so that we might have God’s righteousness

> How does that happen? – when we are saved, Christ’s sinless life is
> imputed to our account and God sees us as though we lived Christ’s
> life

How does God see you right now? As a sinner living in darkness, or as
though you lived Christ’s life?

## Immutability

> <u>Hebrews 13:8</u> – Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
> forever.

Does Jesus Christ change? – no

Did He cease to be God during His incarnation? – no

> What did He do during His incarnation? – He <u>voluntarily</u> laid
> aside the independent use of His divine attributes. *Kenosis*.

#### Christ as King

## Presently Exalted

> <u>Philippians 2:9-10</u> – For this reason also, **<u>God highly
> exalted Him, and bestowed on Him that name which is above every
> name</u>**, so that at the name of Jesus every knee will bow, of those
> who are in heaven and on the earth and under the earth.

Note: recall what we said about the kenosis, which is Philippians 2:5-8.

> What is the tense of the verbs “exalt” and “bestow”? – past; already
> done
>
> Where is Christ right now? – at the right hand of the Father – Hebrews
> 1:3
>
> Why did God highly exalt Christ and bestow on Him the name above every
> name? – so that every knee will bow to Christ
>
> Have you bowed your knee to Christ? Or, are you going to wait until it
> is too late and be forced to bow the knee to Him while you are under
> the earth?

## Second Coming in Power and Glory

> <u>Matthew 24:30</u> – And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear
> in the sky, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they
> will see **<u>the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with
> power and great glory</u>**.
>
> How will Christ return? – in power and great glory
>
> What will the response <u>of those on earth</u> be? – they will mourn
>
> Why? – because they are still in sin and the Judge is coming to judge
> them
>
> What would your reaction be if Christ returned tomorrow? – Fear?
> Shame? Joy?
>
> Are you living as though Christ might return tomorrow? – OPEN
>
> <u>Revelation 19:11-16</u> – 11 And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a
> white horse, and He who sat on it is called Faithful and True, and in
> righteousness He judges and wages war. 12 His eyes are a flame of
> fire, and on His head are many diadems; and He has a name written on
> Him which no one knows except Himself. 13 He is clothed with a robe
> dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God. 14 And the
> armies which are in heaven, clothed in fine linen, white and clean,
> were following Him on white horses. 15 From His mouth comes a sharp
> sword, so that with it He may strike down the nations, and He will
> rule them with a rod of iron; and He treads the wine press of the
> fierce wrath of God, the Almighty. 16 And on His robe and on His thigh
> He has a name written, "KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS."
>
> What is depicted here? – Christ’s second coming
>
> Who will be with Him? – the saints who have gone to heaven (death,
> rapture)
>
> What three ways is Christ referred to as here? – Faithful and true;
> the Word of God; King of kings and Lord of lords.
>

> against the nations
>
> Will He triumph? – Yes. Amen.

<u>Psalm 2</u> – Messianic psalm

## Second Coming Will Bring Judgment

> <u>2 Thessalonians 1:4-10</u> – 4 therefore, we ourselves speak
> proudly of you among the churches of God for your perseverance and
> faith in the midst of all your persecutions and afflictions which you
> endure. 5 This is a plain indication of God's righteous judgment so
> that you will be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which
> indeed you are suffering. 6 For after all **<u>it is only just for God
> to repay with affliction those who afflict you</u>**, 7 and to give
> relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well **<u>when the Lord
> Jesus will be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming
> fire, 8 dealing out retribution to those who do not know God and to
> those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus</u>**. 9 **<u>These
> will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of
> the Lord and from the glory of His power, 10 when He comes to be
> glorified in His saints on that day</u>**, and to be marveled at among
> all who have believed--for our testimony to you was believed.
>
> What will Christ bring when He returns? – judgment
>
> Who will He repay? – those who afflict believers
>
> To whom will He deal out retribution? – to those who do not know God
> and to those who do not believe the gospel
>
> What is the gospel? – Jesus died on the Cross to pay the penalty for
> our sins, and by believing in Him we will not perish but have eternal
> life.
>
