FOF Class Plan - Lesson 10

Spiritual Gifts

1.  Introduction

    1.  Background on Church

Last week that we looked at the Church as the Body of Christ. The Body
of Christ is one organism with numerous members, each with a different
function or different ministry in the Body. 1 Cor. 12:14-27. Functions
may overlap to some degree, but each of us in the Body of Christ has a
non-identical *giftedness* that must be used to: (1) edify one another;
(2) serve one another; (3) bear one another’s burdens; (4) assist one
another in confessing sins.

2.  Introduction to Gifts

Spiritual gifts are God-given capacities for spiritual service. They are
supernaturally bestowed by God the Holy Spirit *upon believers only*.
The NT passages addressing spiritual gifts are written to believers
(Romans 12; 1 Cor. 12-14; 1 Peter 4:10-11).

Spiritual gifts differ from talents. Talents are something we are born
with. Believers and non-believers have talents. With believers, however,
God may use our talents together with our spiritual giftedness.

We are given spiritual gifts for:

1)  the **common good** of the Body of Christ

2)  the **edification**, or building up, of the Body

3)  **serving one another** in the Body

> We must exercise our spiritual giftedness with love, or else our
> giftedness is useless.

The details of the gifts are outlined in the Lesson. I encourage you all
to review these carefully, as we will not go into a lot of detail on
them in class. They are primarily depicted in Romans 12:6-8 and 1
Corinthians 12-14. They come in two general categories: (1) permanent
gifts, and (2) temporary gifts. The permanent gifts are for building up
the church, and continue to exist in the church today. The temporary
gifts were for confirming and authenticating the testimony of the
apostles as a true message from God (Romans 15:18-21; Hebrews 2:1-4),
and ceased to operate as the early church was established and Scripture
was written.

The **<u>permanent gifts</u>** are: (1) prophecy; (2) teaching; (3)
faith; (4) wisdom; (5) knowledge (6) discernment; (7) mercy; (8)
exhortation; (9) giving; (10) administration/ leadership; (11) helps;
(12) service.

The **<u>temporary gifts</u>** are: (1) miracles; (2) healing; (3)
tongues and interpretation of tongues.

An important task to undertake once you have your feet on the ground as
a new Christian in a church is to seek to identify your giftedness, and
then to exercise it. We will discuss this later, but pay attention to
where the Lord seems to be drawing you.

I can say for myself, and perhaps you can say it better than me, is that
I may have the gift of teaching. It was suggested to me once to teach in
our Bible study to see if I had a gift for teaching. And, it was
suggested to me that I get trained to teach FOF. I did not come up with
either idea, but simply followed the suggestions of some trusted
friends/shepherds, and went with it. The Lord seems to be using me in a
positive way, so I am going to stick with it.

Other times, our gifts will be fairly evident to us – perhaps with
giving, or mercy, if we tend to have that type of disposition.

Anyways, it is critical to identify our giftedness, because it is
unique, and if we are not exercising our gifts, no one else can because
no one else has the same fingerprint of giftedness that we do. Failure
to identify and exercise our gifts is a detriment to the Body. It would
be as if one of our eyes did not see, or one of our organs did not work
properly.

2.  Giving of Spiritual Gifts

    1.  Spiritual Gifts are Given by the Holy Spirit

> <u>1 Corinthians 12:11</u> – But one and **<u>the same Spirit works
> all these things, distributing to each one individually just as He
> wills</u>**.
>
> <u>Context</u> – Paul recites a number of gifts in 1 Corinthians
> 12:4-10 (“all these things”)
>
> Who distributes the spiritual gifts? – the Holy Spirit
>
> Is He influenced by anyone or anything in deciding what gifts to give
> each believer? – no

2.  At the Moment of Salvation

> Context of 1 Corinthians 12:4-13 relates to the Holy Spirit giving a
> believer his or her giftedness, according to His will and nothing
> else, in the same breath as He baptizes believers into the Body of
> Christ, <u>at the moment of salvation</u>. So, believers receive their
> giftedness at the moment of salvation.

3.  Each Christian has a Special Giftedness

> <u>1 Peter 4:10</u> – As **<u>each one has received a special
> gift</u>**, employ it in serving one another as good stewards of the
> manifold grace of God
>
> Who receives spiritual gifts? – believers (1 Peter 3:21)
>
> How many gifts does each believer receive? – one (“a”)
>
> Does that mean we have only one gift? – no; it can be a mixture (each
> believer has his or her own unique “fingerprint” of giftedness)

3.  Purposes of Spiritual Gifts

    1.  For the Common Good

> <u>1 Corinthians 12:7</u> – But to each one is given the manifestation
> of the Spirit **<u>for the common good</u>**.
>
> What is a purpose of spiritual giftedness? – for the common good (in
> the church)
>
> What would be an example of this? - OPEN

2.  For the Edification of the Church

> <u>1 Corinthians 14:12</u> – So also you, since you are zealous of
> spiritual gifts, seek to abound **<u>for the edification of the
> church</u>**.
>
> <u>Context</u> – part of the reason why Paul was writing to the
> Corinthian church was because they were abusing their spiritual gifts.
> They were zealous for them, but they were not using them properly.
> They used them to attract attention to themselves, which created
> divisions in the body of Christ there. Paul was writing to correct
> their understanding and practice of their spiritual gifts.

How does Paul describe the Corinthians’ attitude about spiritual gifts?
– they are zealous

What does he exhort them to do? – abound in their gifts

What does “abound” mean? – let them flourish, let them be prevalent

What is the purpose of letting their gifts abound? – to edify the church

What does it mean to “edify”? – to build up

What would be an example of this? - OPEN

3.  For Serving One Another

> <u>1 Peter 4:10</u> – As each one has received a special gift,
> **<u>employ it in serving one another as good stewards of the manifold
> grace of God</u>**
>
> What are believers to do with their spiritual gifts? – employ them in
> serving one another
>
> What does “employ” mean? – do it, use it – a command (<u>Romans
> 12:6</u> – to “exercise”).
>
> What is a steward? – someone entrusted with something – we are
> entrusted to employ our spiritual gifts in service within the church
>
> Do we earn these gifts? – no
>
> What is the source of our giftedness? – the manifold grace of God
>
> Who are the beneficiaries of our giftedness? – one another (not
> ourselves)

4.  Spiritual Gifts Must Be Exercised in Love

> <u>1 Corinthians 13:1-7</u> – If I speak with the tongues of men and
> of angels, **<u>but do not have love</u>**, I have become a noisy
> going or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy, and know
> all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I have all faith, so as to
> remove mountains, **<u>but do not have love</u>**, I am nothing. And
> if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, and if I surrender my
> body to be burned, **<u>but do not have love</u>**, it profits me
> nothing. Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love does
> not brag and is not arrogant, does not seek its own, is not provoked,
> does not take into account a wrong suffered, does not rejoice in
> unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth; bears all things,
> believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
>
> <u>context</u> – this passage comes right in the middle of chapters 12
> and 14, which both discuss spiritual gifts in great detail
>
> Paul says if I do this or if I do that – what is he referring to? –
> exercising spiritual gifts
>
> What does Paul say we must have for our gifts to be effective? – love
>
> What is the result if we exercise our gifts without love? – they are
> useless, we are nothing, others derive no benefit from it.
>
> What is love according to 1 Corinthians 13? – patient, kind, not
> jealous, not bragging, not arrogant, not selfish, not provoked,
> overlooks wrong, does not rejoice in unrighteousness, rejoices in the
> truth, bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things,
> endures all things.
>
> The immediate context pertains to the exercise of spiritual gifts.
> When teaching, serving, helping, exhorting, or whatever, we need to do
> it with love – the kind of love described here in 1 Corinthians 13.
>
> But the definition of love is more general than just spiritual gifts.
> We need to exhibit these love characteristics to one another at all
> times, regardless of the situation.

5.  The Gifts (**skip if time is running low**) – can ask what each
    means…

    1.  Permanent

        1.  <u>Prophecy</u> – to declare or tell forth the Scripture;
            can, but does not necessarily mean foretelling. In fact, the
            foretelling aspect of it ceased when the canon of Scripture
            was completed.

        2.  <u>Teaching</u> – the ability to teach the Word of God and
            give others the understanding of Scripture that the authors
            intended

        3.  <u>Faith</u> – a consistent trust and reliance on God in
            spite of tremendous obstacles and difficulties; often
            manifested in persistent prayer

        4.  <u>Wisdom</u> – the ability to apply knowledge of Scripture

        5.  <u>Knowledge</u> – understanding of Scripture; the ability
            to know Scripture in a broad and deep way

        6.  <u>Discernment</u> – the ability to distinguish truth from
            error/things of the Spirit and things not of the Spirit;
            protects the church

        7.  <u>Mercy</u> – the ability to show deep compassion for those
            with spiritual, physical, and/or emotional needs

        8.  <u>Exhortation</u> – the ability to encourage and motivate
            others to deepen their spiritual commitment and action (must
            be done with love)

        9.  <u>Giving</u> – material giving of money, clothes, food,
            etc. in response to the needs of the church

        10. <u>Administration/Leadership</u> – this is the ability to
            oversee the flock – not just pastors and elders, but those
            overseeing groups, organizations, etc. within the church

        11. <u>Helps</u> – giving aid in a time of need; bearing one
            another’s burdens

        12. <u>Service</u> – working for the body of Christ in physical
            ministry such as setting things up, maintenance, etc.

    2.  Temporary\*\*\* - **see last page of notes**

        1.  <u>Miracles</u> – the ability to do signs and wonders –
            Jesus performed many miracles; Paul also used this gift in 2
            Cor. 12:12

        2.  <u>Healing</u> – the ability to immediately and completely
            heal - Peter had this gift (Acts 3:6-8; Acts 5:15-16) as a
            means of affirming that what he proclaimed was from God

        3.  <u>Tongues and Interpretation of Tongues</u> – the ability
            to speak a language formerly not known to the speaker,
            accompanied by the gift of interpreting the same

6.  Discovering Your Giftedness

    1.  Know that you have one or more spiritual gifts

    2.  Be aware of the possibilities and purposes of the gifts in
        today’s church

    3.  Pray for enlightenment regarding your giftedness

    4.  Consider your natural abilities and resources – not always
        determinative

    5.  Experiment with all of the gifts – take 4-6 months to experiment
        with each

    6.  Evaluate the experimentation

    7.  Seek out respected and mature Christians to see if we
        impact/benefit others

    8.  Realize that you may have more than one spiritual gift

    9.  Evaluate the extent of your giftedness – we may have more
        ability in one more than others – simply because you are not
        extraordinary at something does not mean you do not have a gift
        – just that you may be more gifted in other areas.

7.  Exhortation to Discover and Exercise Gift

<u>Romans 12:6-8</u> – **<u>Since we have gifts</u>** that differ
according to the grace given each of us, **<u>each of is to exercise
them accordingly</u>**; if prophecy, according to the proportion of his
faith; if service, in his serving; or he who teaches, in his teaching;
or he who exhorts, in his exhortation; he who gives, with liberality; he
who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.

What is Paul exhorting us to do? – exercise our giftedness

Are you exercising your giftedness?

Do you even know what your giftedness is?

Note that each believer has a separate gift or mixture of gifts. No two
believers have the same gift or mixture of gifts. Each believer has a
purpose and function in the body, and if we do not know our gifts and/or
are not exercising our giftedness, we deprive the body of our function
and our gifts. It is as if a part of our body simply did not work.

<u>1 Corinthians 12:12-26</u> – READ.

Therefore, I urge you to seek to identify your giftedness and get busy
exercising your gifts.

**<u>Temporary Gifts/Cessationism</u>** –

<u>2 Corinthians 12:12</u> – no true apostles after the 12 and Paul.

- Why? – because one of the requirements of being a “true” apostle was
  to be an eyewitness of the risen Christ – Acts 1:22.

<u>Hebrews 2:3-4</u> – the Word of God was confirmed, when first given,
by signs, wonders, and miracles given to “those who heard” the gospel
“first spoken by the Lord.” And “God also testifying with
**<u>them</u>** \[the apostles\] … .”

<u>Biblical Doctrine, p. 804</u> – “Once the apostolic age ended and the
New Testament canon was complete, the gifts uniquely associated with the
offices of apostle and prophet were no longer needed and passed away.
Now, the completed canon of the sufficient Scripture stands as its own
self-authentication, being the full revelation of the mind and will of
God.”

There have not been any apostles since the end of the first century
(because anyone of them who saw the risen Christ had died by that point
– John probably the last one).

Not everything that happened in the early church as the Word of God was
being proclaimed was intended to continue and be the “norm” throughout
the church age.

What we see in today’s charismatic movement are not miraculous sign
gifts, but counterfeits and forgeries.
