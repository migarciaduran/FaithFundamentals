FOF Lessons 12 & 13 – Obedience and God’s Will – Part 2

1.  Introduction

Last class – and the topic is apropos. If I want to leave you with a
single point for all that we have done, aside from making sure that you
have submitted your lives to Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, it would
be <u>Ephesians 5:17</u> - understand what the will of the Lord is, and
<u>Ecclesiastes 12:13</u> - fear God and keep His commandments.
Obedience is about showing our love to God, from the heart, in gratitude
for all that He has done for us, and in submission to Him as Lord. It
pleases God and it glorifies God. As such, that should be our desire and
focus.

And, we ended last week’s class looking at how we might know God’s will
for a given situation. So, whether it is a direct command of Scripture,
or a situation in which we must surmise God’s will from the principles
of Scripture and the surrounding circumstances, we will then need to ask
the question about how should we go about obeying God?

2.  How do we obey?

These are practical pointers to help us with our obedience. They fall
into two categories – one that pertains to <u>our attitude and
heart</u>, and another that is more <u>practical</u>.

1.  Heart Issues Pertaining to Obedience

    1.  Willingness

> <u>John 7:17</u> – **<u>If any man is willing to do His will</u>**, he
> shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or whether I speak
> from myself.
>
> What is a key attitude we need for obedience? – willingness to obey
>
> If we are willing to obey, what will we know? – if something is God’s
> will
>
> Are you willing to obey God in all things?

2.  Trusting in the Lord

<u>Proverbs 3:5-6</u> – **<u>Trust in the Lord with all your
heart</u>**, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways
acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight.

> What three things do we need to do so that the Lord will direct our
> paths according to His will? – trust in Him with all our hearts, do
> not lean on our understanding, acknowledge Him in all our ways
>
> Do we just kind of trust the Lord indifferently? – No, with all our
> hearts!
>
> What does it mean to acknowledge the Lord in all our ways? – to
> reflect on Him and think about Him in all our ways, in everything we
> do.

3.  Praying for Wisdom

> <u>James 1:5</u> – But **<u>if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of
> God</u>**, who gives to all men generously and without reproach, and
> it will be given to him

If a believer is not sure of a certain path to take, what should he/she
do? – pray to God for wisdom.

> Will he/she receive it? - yes

4.  Seeking Godly Counsel

> <u>Proverbs 1:5</u> – A wise man will hear and increase in learning,
> and **<u>a man of understanding will acquire wise counsel</u>**
>
> What else can do if we are not sure about God’s will? – seek godly
> counsel
>
> If we realize we do not know what to do, and we seek help, what trait
> in us is that a sign of? - humility

2.  Practical Pointers to Help with our Obedience

<!-- -->

1.  Imitate Christ

> <u>Ephesians 5:1-2</u> – Therefore, **<u>be imitators of God</u>**, as
> beloved children; and **<u>walk in love</u>**, just as Christ also
> loved you and gave Himself up for us as an offering and a sacrifice to
> God as a fragrant aroma.
>
> What are we commanded to do in verse 1? – be imitators of God
>
> What does it mean to imitate? – to do the same thing as
>
> What examples are given of things we should imitate? – walk in love,
> sacrifice ourselves for others.
>
> Are you imitating God in your life?

2.  Set our minds on things above – have a heavenly perspective

> <u>Colossians 3:1-2</u> – Therefore, **<u>if you have been raised up
> with Christ</u>**, **<u>keep seeking the things above</u>**, where
> Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. **<u>Set your mind on the
> things above</u>**, not on the things that are on earth.
>
> Who is Paul addressing here? – believers
>
> What language tells you that? – if you have been raised up with Christ
>
> What is Paul’s command to believers? – keep seeking the things above
>
> Is that a one-time suggestion? – no – command to do it continuously
>
> Where does Paul say to set our minds? – on things above
>
> Such as? – Christ, heaven, God’s glory
>
> What are we not to focus on? – things of the earth

3.  The Struggle of Obedience

Obedience is not always easy. We will undergo trials.

<u>1 Peter 4:12</u> – Beloved, **<u>do not be surprised at the fiery
ordeal among you, which comes upon you for your testing</u>**, as though
some strange thing were happening to you.

What does Peter say we should not be surprised about? – trials

Why are trials sent our way? – to test our faith

<u>James 1:2-4</u> – **<u>Consider it all joy, my brethren, when you
encounter various trials</u>**, knowing that **<u>the testing of your
faith produces endurance</u>**. And **<u>let endurance have its perfect
result, so that you may be perfect and complete</u>**, lacking in
nothing.

What should our attitude be when trials come? – joy

What does the testing of our faith produce? – endurance (*hupomone*)

If we respond to trials with joy and overcoming endurance, what is the
result? – we are being perfected and completed.

Also, our sinful nature still tugs at us. We are tempted to do what we
should not do. We still have a desire to be popular/friendly. The world
will continue to attract us to some degree, and we must be prepared for
it. Realize that we are eternally secure in Christ, that He has
purchased our salvation, and that He maintains our salvation. But, also
realize that there is a sin principle still in us, and be prepared to
battle it at all costs so that we can show our love for God.

<u>Romans 7:14-25</u> – For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am
of flesh, sold into bondage to sin. For what I am doing, I do not
understand; for I am not practicing what I would like to do, but I am
doing the very thing I hate. But if I do the very thing I do not want to
do, I agree with the Law, confessing that the Law is good. So now, no
longer am I the one doing it, but sin which dwells in me. For I know
that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh; for the willing is
present in me, but the doing of good is not. For the good that I want, I
do not do, but I practice the very evil that I do not want. But if I am
doing the very thing I do not want, I am no longer the one doing it, but
sin which dwells in me. I find then the principle that evil is present
in me, the one who wants to do good. For I joyfully concur with the law
of God in the inner man, but I see a different law in the members of my
body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of
the law of sin which is in my members. Wretched man that I am! Who will
set me free from the body of this death? Thanks be to God through Jesus
Christ our Lord! So then, one the one hand I myself with my mind am
serving the law of God, but on the other, with my flesh the law of sin.

What is his Paul’s dilemma here? –he is not doing what he wants to do,
and he is doing what he hates. SOUND FAMILIAR??

What does he agree with and find is good despite his ongoing sin? – the
law

What is the principle that is working in him causing him to do what he
does not want to do? – sin

How does he describe the interplay of the law of his mind and the law of
his members? – war

Who does he praise despite his wretchedness? – God through Christ

In Christ, we have a new inner man, but the old flesh is still there and
still wars against our minds, which know the right things to do. We will
be eternally freed from this when we die. But, at present, our flesh
remains and it is the landing point for Satan’s temptation. He appeals
to our flesh to tempt us to sin.

What can we do in the here and now to overcome this sin principle in our
members?

<u>1 Corinthians 9:24-27</u> – Do you not know that those who run in a
race all run, but only one receives the prize? **<u>Run in such a way
that you may win</u>**. Everyone who competes in the games
**<u>exercises self-control in all things</u>**. They then do it to
receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. Therefore, I run in
such a way, as not without aim; I box in such a way, as not beating the
air; but I discipline my body and make it my slave, so that, after I
have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified.

In v. 27, Paul mentions his goal – what is it? - not being disqualified
from preaching b/c of sin.

What metaphor for the Christian life does Paul use here? – a race

How does Paul say we must run? – to win

What is one of the ways we run to win? – exercise self-control in all
things

What is self-control? – restraining ourselves when temptation comes

Compared to the discipline and self-control an athlete exerts to receive
a temporary earthly reward, how much harder should we who will receive
an imperishable reward run (rhetorical)?

What does it mean to run as not without aim, and to box as not beating
the air? – Paul says we must be focused on the task at hand (exerting
self-control)

What does Paul do to his body? – disciplines it and makes it his slave

If we give into temptation and sin, is our body our slave? – no, we are
slaves of our body

So, we need to discipline ourselves, control our bodies, and exert
self-control as we battle the world, the flesh, and the devil.

<u>Ephesians 6:10-18</u> – another great passage that we could spend an
entire class on - **HANDOUT**

4.  The Blessings of Obedience

Think about all that God has done for the believer in Christ – the
grace, the forgiveness, the mercy, the love. That alone should create
such a heart of thanks in us that we should willfully desire to obey
God. But, God’s grace is so lavish and so amazing, that He promises to
bless our obedience, as if the forgiveness of sins was not enough!!

<u>Psalm 19:11b</u> – (context – the law of the Lord, the testimony of
the Lord, the precepts of the Lord, the commandment of the Lord, the
fear of the Lord, the judgments of the Lord) – **<u>In keeping them
there is great reward</u>**.

What do we have if we obey God’s word? – great reward

<u>Romans 6:22</u> - But now having been freed from sin and enslaved to
God, you derive your benefit, resulting in **<u>sanctification</u>**,
and **<u>the outcome, eternal life</u>**.

As slaves of God, as believers obedient to God, what is our benefit? –
sanctification

What is sanctification? – growth in holiness and Christ-likeness

What is the ultimate outcome of our obedience to God? – eternal life

Think about this – God chose us from before the foundation of the world
to be saved by the precious blood of Christ shed for us on the cross. He
regenerated our hearts to believe, and He justified us, sanctifies us
and helps us to obey Him, and He will glorify those who obey God and
give evidence of our salvation with the outcome - eternal life in
heaven. We deserve nothing, but God has given us everything. We should
fall on our faces and simply praise and thank Him for His incredible,
lavish grace.

Prayer.
