FOF Class Plan – Lesson 5 (The Work of Jesus Christ)

Over the past two classes, we looked at the person of Jesus Christ – His
titles, His Incarnation, the Kenosis (His emptying Himself of the
independent use of his divine prerogatives and attributes), The
Transfiguration (where Jesus revealed His glory to Peter, John, and
James), Christ as God and King, and how Christ will come in His return.

1.  Introduction

Today and next Sunday we will look at the *Work* of Jesus Christ,
including:

- What sin is

- Man’s total depravity and our need for Christ’s work on our behalf

- The particulars of the work of Christ – his sacrifice for us

- God’s Judgment at the Cross

- Christ’s death

- Christ’s resurrection and continuing work

- What Christ’s work has accomplished for us

Our Goals will be to:

- Explain man’s need for a Savior

- To show the cost of Christ’s work

- To show what Christ’s work provides

- To present the resurrected Christ

- A call to repentance

2.  Sin

How would you describe sin? – disobedience to God; lawlessness

Greek word – *hamartia* – means “missing the mark” like in archery

Another definition – “any lack of conformity to God’s will in attitude,
thought, or action, whether committed actively or passively.” (Biblical
Doctrine, 454).

1.  What is Sin?

    1.  Sin is lawlessness

> <u>1 John 3:4</u> – Everyone who practices sin also practices
> lawlessness; and **<u>sin is lawlessness</u>**
>
> What is sin? – lawlessness
>
> What is lawlessness? – the quality of being without the law;
> transgression

2.  Sin is Failing to Do What You Know is Right

> <u>James 4:17</u> – Therefore, **<u>to one who knows the right thing
> to do and does not do it, to him it is sin</u>**.
>
> How does this verse characterize sin? – failing to do what we know to
> be right
>
> How often do you find yourself in that position?

3.  Sin is having immoral thoughts

> <u>Matthew 5:28</u> – But I say to you that **<u>everyone who looks at
> a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in
> his heart</u>**
>
> Does this verse say that a one must consummate his lustful feelings
> towards a woman in order for adultery to have been committed? – No
>
> What constitutes the adultery here? – the thoughts
>
> Do you ever have lustful thoughts about another? (thought question
> only)

4.  Obscene Speech is Sin

> <u>Colossians 3:8</u> – But now you also, **<u>put</u>** them all
> **<u>aside</u>**: anger, wrath, malice, **<u>slander, and abusive
> speech from your mouth</u>**
>
> What types of speech are we commanded to put aside? – slander (lies);
> abusive speech
>
> So, sin is lawlessness, disobedience, missing God’s mark

3.  Man is Sinful and Depraved and Needs the Work of Christ

    1.  Man Has a Sinful Nature

> <u>Ephesians 2:1-3</u> – And you were **<u>dead in your trespasses and
> sins</u>**, in which you formerly **<u>walked according to the course
> of this world</u>**, **<u>according to the prince of the power of the
> air</u>**, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of
> disobedience. Among them we too all formerly lived in the lusts of our
> flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by
> nature children of wrath, even as the rest.

How does this verse describe our lives before salvation? – dead in sin

> What two phrases are used to describe who we were before salvation? –
> (1) sons of disobedience; (2) children of wrath
>
> And we were by nature children of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_? – wrath
> (we have a sinful nature)
>
> How did we walk? – according to the world, according to the prince of
> the power of the air
>
> Who is the prince of the power of the air? – Satan
>
> How did we formerly live? – in the lusts of our flesh, indulging the
> desires of our mind
>
> What is the flesh? - OPEN

2.  Man is a Slave to Sin

> <u>John 8:34</u> – Jesus answered them, “Truly, truly, I say to you,
> **<u>everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin</u>**.

How many people commit sin? – everyone

How many people are slaves of sin, then? – everyone

Who said this? – Jesus Himself

What does it mean to be the slave of sin? - OPEN

3.  Man’s Condition is Depraved and Hopeless

> <u>Psalm 14:3</u> – They have all turned aside, together they have
> become corrupt; **<u>there is no one who does good, not even
> one</u>**.
>
> How many of us have turned aside and become corrupt? – all of us
>
> What does it mean to turn aside? – to turn away from God and His law
>
> How many of us do good? – none
>
> <u>Jeremiah 17:9</u> – The heart is more deceitful than all else and
> is desperately sick
>
> What does Jeremiah say about our hearts? – that it is more deceitful
> than all else and desperately sick
>
> What does that mean? – OPEN
>
> <u>Romans 3:23</u> – for all have sinned and fall short of the glory
> of God
>
> How many of us have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God? – all
> of us
>
> <u>Isaiah 64:6</u> – for all of us have become like one who is
> unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a filthy garment
>
> How many of us are unclean? – all of us
>
> To God, what are our righteous deeds like? – a filthy garment
>
> What does “filthy garment” mean? – OPEN
>
> What does this mean? - OPEN
>
> In our unsaved condition, is there anything we can do to save
> ourselves? …
>
> <u>Jeremiah 13:23</u> – Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the
> leopard his spots? Then you also can do good who are accustomed to
> doing evil.
>
> Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots? – NO
>
> Can we do good who are accustomed to doing evil? - NO
>
> We are sinners by nature, completely depraved and totally separated
> from God - we need a new nature that only Christ can supply.

4.  Consequences of Man’s Sin

    1.  <u>Alienation from God</u> – just think about what happened in
        the Garden of Eden. After Adam and Eve sinned (by eating the
        fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil – the
        forbidden fruit – Genesis 2:16-17), God kicked them out of the
        garden and stationed His cherubim (a class of holy angels) to
        guard the entrance to the garden so that Adam and Eve could not
        return. Genesis 3:24. **<u>Sin destroys our fellowship with
        God</u>**.

    2.  We are God’s enemies

> <u>James 4:4</u> – do you not know that **<u>friendship with the world
> is hostility toward God</u>**? Therefore, whoever wishes to be a
> friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God
>
> What does friendship with the world mean? – OPEN
>
> What is friendship with the world? – hostility towards God
>
> What is a person who is a friend of the world? – enemy of God
>
> Are you a friend of the world or a friend of God?

3.  Death

> <u>Ezekiel 18:4 and 18:20</u> – “the soul who sins will die.” – JUST
> READ
>
> <u>Romans 6:23</u> – For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift
> of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
>
> What is the wages of sin? – death
>
> What is the gift of God? – eternal life in Christ
>
> How much did this gift cost Jesus? – everything; shame; death;
> separation from Father
>
> What does this gift cost to the sinner? – nothing – it is free
>
> What does that mean to you? – OPEN

4.  Facing Eternal Condemnation and Separation from God

> <u>2 Thessalonians 1:8-9</u> - dealing out **<u>retribution</u>** to
> those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of
> our Lord Jesus. 9 These will pay the **<u>penalty of eternal
> destruction, away from the presence of the Lord</u>** and from the
> glory of His power.
>
> We looked at this passage last week
>
> What do people who do not know God or do not obey the gospel of our
> Lord Jesus Christ face? – retribution; eternal destruction
>
> What is the gospel of Christ? - OPEN

5.  Helpless to Save Ourselves

> <u>Romans 5:6</u> – For while we were still **<u>helpless</u>**, at
> the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
>
> In what way are we helpless? – OPEN
>
> Separated from God; unable to do any righteous deeds to please God;
> unable to understand God; lost; facing death and eternal separation
> from God because of sin. **<u>We need Christ</u>**.

4.  The Work of Christ

    1.  The Need for a Sacrifice

        1.  Forgiveness Requires the Shedding of Blood

> <u>Hebrews 9:22</u> – And according to the Law, one may almost say,
> all things are cleansed with blood, and **<u>without the shedding of
> blood there is no forgiveness</u>**.
>
> What is required for forgiveness? – shedding of blood

2.  God set the requirement that forgiveness requires the shedding of
    blood

> <u>Leviticus 17:11</u> – For the life of the flesh is in the blood,
> and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your
> souls; for it is the blood by reason of the life that makes atonement.
>
> What is atonement? – OPEN (forgiveness of sin by payment for the sin)
>
> What is required for atonement? – blood
>
> How was that provided for in the OT? – sacrificial animals
>
> How is it provided for in the NT? – Christ
>
> Who did the OT sacrifices point to? – Christ
>
> So, what is needed to atone for our sins? – shedding of blood

2.  The Provision of a Sacrifice

> <u>John 3:16</u> – For God so **<u>loved</u>** the world, that **<u>He
> gave</u>** **<u>His only begotten Son</u>**, that whoever
> **<u>believes in Him</u>** shall not perish, but have eternal life.

Who has God given us as a provision for eternal life? – His only
begotten Son

What is necessary to have eternal life? – believe in Christ

What attribute of God motivated His giving of Christ? – love

> <u>2 Corinthians 5:21</u> – **<u>He made Him who knew no sin to be sin
> on our behalf</u>**, so that we might become the righteousness of God
> in Him.

Who is Him who knew no sin? – Christ

What does that say about Christ? – He was sinless

Who made Him who knew no sin to sin on our behalf? – the Father

Do any of us know no sin? – No

On whose behalf did God make the Sinless One sin? – ours; believers

Why? – that we might become the righteousness of God in Him

> What does it mean “that we might become the righteousness of God in
> Him”? – OPEN – imputation of Christ’s righteousness to us so that we
> can stand before God blameless

God provided the sacrifice for our sins in Christ.

3.  The Cost of the Sacrifice – the price Christ paid for our
    forgiveness

    1.  <u>Christ’s Humiliation</u> – discussed this past several weeks
        – the Incarnation, the Kenosis, Christ emptying Himself of the
        independent use of His divine prerogatives and taking the form
        of a bondservant, being made in the likeness of man; He gave up
        the glory and adoration He was entitled to as God, knowing that
        He was to suffer and die an ugly death.

    2.  Despised of Men

> <u>Isaiah 53:3</u> – **<u>He was despised and forsaken of men</u>**, a
> **<u>man of sorrows</u>** and **<u>acquainted with grief</u>**; and
> **<u>like one from whom men hide their face He was despised</u>**, and
> **<u>we did not esteem Him</u>**.
>
> Context – this is a key prophecy of Isaiah of the Messiah as a
> Suffering Servant
>
> What does the prophecy say people’s attitudes would be towards the
> Messiah? – they would despise Him, not esteem (hold in high regard)
> Him, they would forsake Him
>
> What does this picture with respect to Christ? – people’s rejection
> and hatred of Him
>
> What insights into the Messiah’s emotions are given? – man of sorrows;
> acquainted with grief – Christ suffered internally because those He
> came to save rejected Him
>
> This is part of the reason why Israel rejected her Messiah – they
> expected a king, a mighty conqueror, not a man of sorrows and grief –
> But, they did not know their own Scriptures

3.  The Agony of Bearing Man’s Sins

> <u>Luke 22:41-44</u> – 41 And He withdrew from them about a stone's
> throw, and **<u>He knelt down and began to pray</u>**, 42 saying,
> "Father, if You are willing, remove this cup from Me; yet not My will,
> but Yours be done." 43 **<u>Now an angel from heaven appeared to Him,
> strengthening Him</u>**. 44 And **<u>being in agony</u>** He was
> **<u>praying very fervently</u>**; and **<u>His sweat became like
> drops of blood</u>**, falling down upon the ground.
>
> Context – Jesus in the Garden; night of His arrest; day before His
> crucifixion
>
> Did Jesus know what was about to happen to Him? – yes
>
> What was Jesus experiencing? – v.44 – agony
>
> Why was He in agony? – He was about to bear the punishment for our
> sins
>
> What shows the extent of Jesus agony? – he was sweating drops of blood
>
> As the event drew near, what was His response? – very fervent prayer
>
> What did He pray for? – that the suffering would pass by Him, but not
> as He willed, but as His Father willed
>
> In v. 43, how is God’s grace shown? – he sent an angel to strengthen
> Christ

4.  The Crucifixion – JUST HAVE A STUDENT READ THROUGH THESE

    1.  Arrest – Matthew 26:50-54

    2.  Trial – Matthew 26:59-68

    3.  Before Pilate – Matthew 27:11-26

    4.  Scourging – Matthew 27:27-31

    5.  Crucifixion – Matthew 27:32-37

> So, the cost of the sacrifice for our sins was incomprehensibly high.

4.  Christ’s Death

> <u>John 19:26-30</u> – 26 When Jesus then saw His mother, and the
> disciple whom He loved standing nearby, He said to His mother, "Woman,
> behold, your son!" 27 Then He said to the disciple, "Behold, your
> mother!" From that hour the disciple took her into his own household.
> 28 After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had already been
> accomplished, to fulfill the Scripture, said, "I am thirsty." 29 A jar
> full of sour wine was standing there; so they put a sponge full of the
> sour wine upon a branch of hyssop and brought it up to His mouth. 30
> Therefore when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, "**<u>It is
> finished!</u>**" And **<u>He bowed His head and gave up His
> spirit</u>**.
>
> Where is Christ? – on the cross
>
> What were Christ’s last words? – It is finished
>
> Was He just referring to His crucifixion? – No.
>
> What else was He referring to? - To His paying the price for our sins
>
> Did He die naturally? – No, He *voluntarily* gave up His spirit; He
> was in control – Matthew 27:50; John 10:17-18.

5.  Judgment of God at the Cross

    1.  Christ Forsaken by the Father

> <u>Matthew 27:46</u> – About the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a
> loud voice, saying “Eli, Eli lama sabachthani?” that is, “**<u>My God,
> My God, why have you forsaken me</u>**?”
>
> Where was Jesus? – on the Cross
>
> What does Jesus cry out? – My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?
>
> What is the significance of this statement? – OPEN – Christ was
> experiencing the abandonment and despair that resulted from the
> outpouring of divine wrath on Him as the sin-bearer in our place.
> Remember John 1:1.

2.  All of God’s Wrath Intended for Us Placed on Christ

> <u>Isaiah 53:5</u> – **<u>He was pierced through for our
> transgressions</u>**, **<u>He was crushed for our iniquities</u>**;
> **<u>the chastening for our well-being fell upon Him</u>**, and
> **<u>by His scourging we are healed</u>**.
>
> Whose transgressions did the Messiah suffer for? – ours
>
> What portions of the verse tell us that? – pierced through; crushed;
> chastening; scourging

What does it mean that “the chastening for our well-being fell upon
Him”? – that by the suffering He endured, our peace with God was
procured

What does it mean that “by His scourging we are healed”? – by His
suffering and death, salvation was procured for the elect.

> <u>2 Corinthians 5:21</u> – **<u>He made Him who knew no sin to be sin
> on our behalf</u>**, so that we might become the righteousness of God
> in Him. (***We looked at this verse before***)
>
> <u>1 Peter 2:24</u> – **<u>He Himself bore our sins in His body on the
> cross</u>**, so that we might **<u>die to sin and live to
> righteousness</u>**; **<u>for by His wounds you were healed</u>**.
>
> What did Christ bear in His body on the cross? – our sins
>
> What does it mean to bear sins? – to be punished for them
>
> What attributes of God were satisfied by Christ bearing our sins in
> His body on the cross? – wrath, holiness, righteousness, justice;
> ultimately love, mercy, grace as well.
>
> This is the heart of the gospel – the great doctrine of
> substitutionary atonement – Christ’s death on the Cross atoned for,
> paid for, purchased forgiveness for, all of the sins of all who would
> ever believe in Christ.
>
> How did we die to sin? – sin’s penalty has been paid for those of
> <u>in Christ</u> (we die to sin “vicariously” in Christ); for those of
> us who are not believers, the penalty for your sins will be borne by
> yourself through eternal condemnation in hell, unless you come to
> believe in Christ as Lord and Savior
>
> What does it mean to live to righteousness? Did we instantly become
> sinless when we came to believe? – NO.
>
> What was imputed to us with respect to how God sees believers? –
> Christ’s righteousness
>
> Who indwellt us when we came to believe? – the Holy Spirit
>
> We walk in newness of life, empowered by the Holy Spirit – desiring to
> obey God and putting aside sin
>
> “for by His wounds you were healed” – much like Isaiah 53:5

6.  Christ’s Resurrection

<u>Mark 16:6</u> – And he said to them, “Do not be amazed; you are
looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who has been crucified. **<u>He has
risen</u>**; He is not here; behold, here is the place where they laid
Him.”

**<u>Context</u>** – Mary Magdalene, Mary wife of Clopas (the mother of
James the Less), and Salome (Mother of James and John) came on the
morning of the first day of the week to Jesus’ tomb to anoint His body
with spices. They were concerned that they would not be able to roll
away the large stone that was blocked the entrance to the tomb. When
they arrived, the stone was already removed, and they went into the tomb
and noticed a young man there, and they were amazed. What the young man
said is recorded in Mark 16:6-7.

What happened to Christ? – He had risen

<u>Acts 2:22-24</u> – Men of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus the
Nazarene, a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and
signs which God performed through Him in your midst, just as you
yourselves know – **<u>this Man, delivered over by the predetermined
plan and foreknowledge of God</u>**, you nailed to a cross by the hands
of godless men and put Him to death. **<u>But God raised Him up
again</u>**, putting an end to the agony of death, since it was
impossible for Him to be held in its power.

Was Christ’s death on the cross a last minute, rash decision by God? –
No

What was it a product of? – a predetermined plan; foreknowledge of God

Who nailed Jesus to the cross? – godless men

Who raised Jesus? – God

What was the result of God raising Christ from the dead? – the agony of
death was put to an end

Is this physical death being spoken of here? – no, spiritual death

What is the significance of the resurrection as far as the forgiveness
of our sins? What did the resurrection of Christ say about the
satisfaction of God’s judgment – OPEN - it was ratification by God of
the work Christ had done; it was God’s approval of the payment for our
sins

#### The Necessity of the Resurrection

<u>1 Corinthians 15:13-21</u> – 13 But **<u>if there is no resurrection
of the dead, not even Christ has been raised</u>**; 14and if Christ has
not been raised, then **<u>our preaching is vain</u>**, **<u>your faith
also is vain</u>**. 15 Moreover **<u>we are even found to be false
witnesses of God</u>**, because we testified against God that He raised
Christ, whom He did not raise, if in fact the dead are not raised. 16
For if the dead are not raised, **<u>not even Christ has been
raised</u>**; 17 and if Christ has not been raised, **<u>your faith is
worthless; you are still in your sins</u>**. 18 Then **<u>those also who
have fallen asleep in Christ have perished</u>**. 19 If we have hoped in
Christ in this life only, **<u>we are of all men most to be
pitied</u>**. 20 But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the
**<u>first fruits</u>** of those who are asleep. 21 For since by a man
came death, by a man also came the resurrection of the dead. 22For as in
Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.

What are some of the consequences of Christ not rising from the dead?

v.14 – our preaching is in vain; your faith is in vain

v.15 – Paul is a false witness of the resurrection

v.16 – Christ is still in the grave

v.17 – your faith is worthless; you are still in your sins

v.18 – those who have died have perished

v.19 – we are to be pitied for being deluded

Why is Christ called first fruits? – there would be many to follow -
us!!

v.22 – Adam brought death; Christ brought life

So, the resurrection is absolutely critical to our faith. If Christ was
not resurrected, our sins have not been forgiven, and everything we
teach and believe is in vain and worthless and we are deceived and to be
pitied. Our hope of being raised to spend eternity in heaven with God
would be groundless, and the promise of eternal life offered in the
gospel would be a lie. But, v. 20, Christ has been raised from the dead.
**HANDOUT** – Evidences for the Resurrection.

<u>Miguel Nuñez (from High King of Heaven, p. 89)</u> – “We need the
forgiveness of God, certainly, but we also need the life of Christ. We
need the cross, but we also need the resurrection because we were dead
in sins and transgressions. Apart from Christ, there is no resurrection,
and if there is no resurrection, there is neither life nor gospel. And
if there is no gospel, there is no hope. It’s incredible that Jesus gave
us life by dying. His death is the only death that gives life. I cannot
be born again spiritually without His death.”

<u>Bruce Ware (from The Man Christ Jesus – Theological Reflections on
the Humanity of Christ, Ch. 7 excerpts)</u> – “The atoning death of
Christ was only efficacious because Jesus who died for our sins was a
full and integral human being. Now granted, he had to be more than
merely a man to die for our sins. To be sure, he had to be the God-man
for the atonement to be efficacious. But while he had to be more than a
mere man, he could not have been less than fully a man.”

“So now the question is this: how do we, as humans, pay for our sin if
we are required to pay it ourselves? We pay for it eternally. That is,
we never finish paying for our sin, because our sin requires an infinite
payment. The reason that hell is eternal is simply that justice demand a
full payment for our sin, and a full payment is impossible for finite
humans to render to an infinitely holy God. Therefore, if we pay for our
own sin, we pay forever, and hence there never comes a time when we can
say, ‘It is finished!’”

“We need a human substitute, to be sure. But we need a human whose
payment for sin is of infinite value. Therefore, the only one who can
save us from our sin is the sinless God-man – one who is fully man, as
we are, but one is fully God, so that his payment for our sin can
satisfy the infinite demands of God’s justice against our sins.”

“Therefore, Jesus has to be fully God as well as fully man. He had to be
fully God for the payment he rendered to be of infinite value,
satisfying the demands of an infinitely holy God against our sin. But he
also had to be fully human in order for his death to be substitutionary,
strictly speaking. … So although the infinite value of Christ’s payment
for our sin attaches to his being fully God, the substitutionary nature
of Christ’s death – that he took our place, bore our sin, and died the
death we deserved to die – attaches most squarely to his being fully
human.”

“The Father actually charges his own Son with our sin and guilt in order
that he might pay for them and secure for us the forgiveness and
righteous standing that we then receive by faith. This is the heart of
the gospel, and it is the heart of the work of Christ on the cross.”

“Christ has to be human in order for this imputation of our sin to take
place. If he were divine only, it is inconceivable and impossible that
our sin would be imputed to him. How could his eternal sinless and holy
nature take on sin? … No, the divine nature cannot be tarnished with
sin, and certainly as God (only), Jesus could not have been ‘made sin.’
But the Father *did* make him to be sin, and he did bear our sin in his
body on the cross. Clearly, then, the imputation of our sin to Christ
has in mind his full and perfect humanity that was, at the moment of
that imputation, made what it never had been before – sin.”

7.  Christ’s Continuing Work on Our Behalf

    1.  Intercession for Believers

> <u>Hebrews 7:25</u> – Therefore **<u>He is able</u>** also **<u>to
> save forever</u>** **<u>those who draw near to God through Him</u>**,
> **<u>since He always lives to make intercession for them</u>**.

Let’s just pull this verse apart – it is so rich – it illustrates what
Christ is doing now

Who is He? - Christ

What does it mean that “He is able”? – capable, sufficient power

What is He able to do? – save forever

Save forever who? – those who draw near to God through Him (John 14:6)

How does He save forever? – by always living to make intercession for
them

What is intercession? – pleading on our behalf

Who is Christ interceding to on our behalf? – the Father

> What is Christ saying to the Father? – do not hold their sins against
> them – I paid their sin debt in full
>
> Can we lose our salvation? - No

2.  Preparing a Place for Us

> <u>John 14:2-3</u> – In my Father’s house are many dwelling places; if
> it were not so, I would have told you; for **<u>I go to prepare a
> place for you</u>**. If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come
> again and receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be
> also.
>
> What is Christ doing right now? – preparing a place for us in heaven
>
> What promise does He make to believers? – that he will come back for
> us
>
> When He returns, where will He take us? – heaven

So, Christ is risen; He is interceding for us and preserving our
salvation; He is preparing heaven for us; and He will return for us to
take us home. These are glorious and exciting thoughts.

8.  Conclusion – How can we sum up the work of Christ?

<u>1 John 4:10</u> – In this is **<u>love</u>**, **<u>not that we loved
God</u>**, **<u>but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the
propitiation for our sins</u>**.

Do you recall what propitiation means? – satisfaction of the payment/sin
debt

Was Christ sent to be the propitiation for our sins because we loved
God? – No

Why? – because God loved us

Is there anything in us that deserves God’s love? – No – What is it? -
it is all grace and mercy

9.  Application – Our Response to Christ’s Work

**<u>If you are a Christian</u>**, what should your response be? – thank
Christ continually; worship and praise Him for His Work on your behalf;
strive to love/obey Jesus in the power of the Holy Spirit.

**<u>If you are not a Christian</u>** – recognize who Jesus is (Lord and
Savior); recognize your sinful, hopeless condition without Jesus; repent
of your sins and place your faith and trust in Jesus Christ as your Lord
and Savior (confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your
