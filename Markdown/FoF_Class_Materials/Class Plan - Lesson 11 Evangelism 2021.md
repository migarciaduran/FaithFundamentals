FOF Lesson 11 – Evangelism

1.  Introduction

For Christians, one task that we are called to is to share our faith
with others. This is what we refer to as evangelism. Have you ever
considered what is at stake? Let’s look.

1.  The Narrow Gate

> <u>Matthew 7:13-14</u> – Enter by the **<u>narrow gate</u>**; for the
> ***gate is wide***, and ***the way is broad that leads to
> destruction***, and ***many*** are those who enter it. For **<u>the
> gate is small, and the way is narrow that leads to life</u>**, and
> **<u>few</u>** are those who find it.
>
> How many gates are described here? – two
>
> What are they? – the narrow gate and the wide gate
>
> What is the narrow gate? – the way of the gospel
>
> What is the wide gate? – the way of the world
>
> How many people go through the narrow gate? – **<u>few</u>**
>
> How many people go through the wide gate? - many
>
> Where does the narrow gate lead? – life; heaven
>
> Where does the wide gate lead? – destruction; hell

2.  Hell

> The Bible teaches the existence of eternal hell in Luke 16:19-31 (the
> rich man and Lazarus). Luke 16:26 says that it is impossible to move
> between heaven and hell. Once someone is in hell, they are there
> forever.
>
> What is hell like?
>
> <u>Matthew 13:41-42</u> – a furnace of fire where there will be
> weeping and gnashing of teeth
>
> <u>Luke 16:23-24</u> – torment; agony
>
> <u>Revelation 20:10, 21:8</u> – eternal lake of fire and brimstone

3.  Exhortation/Conviction

> Are you sharing your faith? Not a lot of Christians do – Matthew 9:37
> (harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few)
>
> What path are the people you know (family, friends, co-workers) on? –
> broad or narrow?
>
> We need to get out there and share the good news of Jesus Christ with
> these people.
>
> The goal of the lesson today is to familiarize you with some of the
> basics of witnessing – what it is, the command to do it, what our
> hearts should be like, and some practical helps.

2.  Having a Heart for the Lost

One of the first priorities for evangelism is having a heart for the
lost. If you do not have this, you need to start praying for it.

1.  The Lord had a heart for the lost

> <u>Luke 19:10</u> – the Son of Man has come to **<u>seek and to save
> that which was lost</u>**
>
> Why did Christ come to earth? – to seek and to save that which was
> lost
>
> What should our heart attitude be? – the same as Christ’s

<u>Luke 19:41</u> – And when He approached, **<u>He saw the city and
wept over it</u>**

<u>Context</u> – Jesus entering Jerusalem at the beginning of passion
week

What did Christ do as He entered Jerusalem? – He wept

Why? – they did not believe in Him

How should we feel about the lost?

2.  Paul had a heart for the lost

> <u>2 Corinthians 12:15</u> – And **<u>I will most gladly spend and be
> expended for your souls</u>**. If I love you the more, am I to be
> loved the less?
>
> What was Paul’s main concern? – the souls of others
>
> What about Paul’s life in general affirms this point? – his constant
> missionary activities
>
> What did he say he would do for others’ souls? – spend and be expended
>
> What does it mean to be expended? – to put all his labor and efforts
> into others’ souls
>
> What was Paul’s attitude about spending and being spent? – gladness,
> joy
>
> Do you spend and expend for others’ souls?

3.  The Lord desires all to be saved

> <u>2 Peter 3:9</u> – **<u>The Lord</u>** is not slow about His
> promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, **<u>not
> wishing for any to perish, but for all to come to repentance</u>**.
>
> What is the Lord’s wish? – for none to perish, but all to come to
> repentance
>
> <u>1 Timothy 2:3-4</u> – This is good and acceptable in the sight of
> **<u>God our Savior, who desires all men to be saved and to come to
> the knowledge of the truth</u>**.

What is God’s desire? – that all men be saved and come to the knowledge
of the truth

3.  The Command to Witness

> <u>Matthew 28:19-20</u> – **<u>Go</u>** therefore and **<u>make
> disciples of all the nations</u>**, baptizing them in the name of the
> Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all
> that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of
> the age.

What is the pertinent command of this verse? – Go and make disciples of
all nations

What is a disciple? – a learned follower

What is Jesus’ promise as we embark on this? – He will always be with us

> <u>Acts 1:8</u> – you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come
> upon you; and **<u>you shall be My witnesses</u>** both in Jerusalem,
> and in all Judea and Samaria, and even to the END OF THE EARTH.
>
> What does Jesus tell the disciples they will be? – His witnesses
> throughout the earth.
>
> Witnesses to what? – His life, death, and resurrection; the gospel.

4.  Hindrances to Witnessing

    1.  Fear

> A lot of people are afraid to witness – Why? – **OPEN** (intimidation,
> fear of failure, fear of man – what others will think)
>
> How do we overcome this fear?

1.  Pray for Boldness

> <u>Acts 4:29</u> – And now, Lord, take note of their threats, and
> **<u>grant that thy bondservants may speak Thy word with all
> confidence</u>**

Context – After Christ’s ascension, Peter and John were preaching in
Jerusalem and the Jewish religious leaders had them arrested. They spent
a night in jail, then were interrogated and released. At their release,
they were told not to preach Christ anymore. Peter and John went back to
their fellow believers and prayed.

> What did Peter and John pray for? – boldness in speaking God’s word

2.  Realize that the Gospel comes with power

> <u>Romans 1:16</u> – For **<u>I am not ashamed of the gospel</u>**,
> **<u>for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who
> believes</u>**, to the Jew first and also to the Greek
>
> Was Paul ashamed of the gospel? – No
>
> Why not? – it is the power of God for salvation
>
> So, as we proclaim the gospel to the lost, what is behind us? – God’s
> power

3.  Realize that we witness in the power of God

> <u>1 Corinthians 2:3-5</u> – And I was with you in weakness and in
> fear and in much trembling. And my message and my preaching were not
> in persuasive words of wisdom, but **<u>in demonstration of the Spirit
> and of power</u>**, that your faith should not rest on the wisdom of
> men, **<u>but on the power of God</u>**.
>
> When Paul went to Corinth to spread the gospel, what was his
> condition? – weakness, fear, and trembling – even Paul, the greatest
> missionary ever, was scared!!
>
> How did he describe his preaching? – not in persuasive words of
> wisdom, but of the Spirit and of power.
>
> What does this mean? – he was not some eloquent guy, but an ordinary
> guy with God’s power behind him and the message.
>
> Who ultimately saves men? What is their faith based on? – God’s power
> – we are just told to “Go” and “preach the gospel”
>
> What does this mean for us? – we can overcome fear of witnessing when
> we realize that God’s power is with us, and it is God, not us, who
> saves. We need not be eloquent in order to be effective.

1.  Lack of Training

    1.  Jesus trained His disciples to witness

> <u>Matthew 10:5</u> – These twelve Jesus sent out **<u>after
> instructing them</u>** …
>
> <u>Context</u> – Jesus is sending out twelve disciples to preach the
> gospel to the lost sheep of Israel

2.  Be ready to give an account

> <u>1 Peter 3:15</u> – Sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts,
> **<u>always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to
> give an account for the hope that is in you</u>**, yet with gentleness
> and reverence.
>
> What is the command of this verse? – to be ready to defend your faith;
> to explain the hope that is in you.
>
> What hope? What is the hope of the gospel? – eternal life in heaven
> with Jesus.
>
> Practically speaking, how are we to get trained? – know the gospel,
> memorize Scripture, and even take a class (Grace Evangelism)

5.  Content of Our Witness

> We can preach the gospel until we are blue in the face, but unless we
> have exemplary lives and a good testimony, our preaching will not be
> believable. The Church is full of hypocrites who destroy the testimony
> of Christ. Our credibility as proclaimers of the gospel depends on the
> quality of our walk.

1.  Our Own Life/Testimony

> <u>Philippians 2:14-15</u> – Do all things **<u>without complaining or
> disputing</u>**; that you may **<u>prove yourselves to be blameless
> and innocent, children of God above reproach</u>** in the midst of a
> crooked and perverse generation, among whom you appear as lights in
> the world.

How must we be perceived in the world, so that we are lights in the
world? – without complaining or disputing, blameless, innocent, above
reproach

> What does it mean to be above reproach? – that no one can bring a
> legitimate accusation against us
>
> Can we just tell people we are above reproach? – No
>
> What must we do? – prove it to the unbelieving world (“in the midst of
> …”)
>
> How? – by our speech and actions
>
> <u>Matthew 5:14-16</u> – **<u>You are the light of the world</u>**. A
> city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do men light a lamp, and put
> in under the peck-measure, but on the lampstand; and it gives light to
> all who are in the house. **<u>Let your light shine before men in such
> a way that they see your good works, and glorify your Father, who is
> in heaven</u>**.
>
> This is from the Sermon on the Mount
>
> How does Christ refer to Christians? – as lights of the world
>
> What does He command us to do? – let our lights shine before men
>
> For what purpose? – so that they see our good works and glorify God
>
> So, the first part of the message is *having a life that is consistent
> with the gospel*.

2.  The Message

> The message is Christ.
>
> <u>1 Corinthians 15:3-4</u> – For I delivered to you as of **<u>first
> importance</u>** what I also received, that **<u>Christ died for our
> sins</u>** according to the Scriptures, and that **<u>He was
> buried</u>**, and that **<u>He was raised on the third day</u>**
> according to the Scriptures.
>
> What does Paul say about the priority of this message? – of first
> importance
>
> What is the message? – Christ died, was buried, and was resurrected
>
> What must happen in order that a person be saved? – <u>Romans
> 10:9-10</u> – READ.

3.  Points to Cover When Presenting the Gospel – **have students read
    verses if time**

    1.  **Separation between man and God** – man’s sinfulness (Romans
        3:23/God’s holiness and justice ); Isaiah 59:1-2/separation
        between man and God because of man’s sin)

    2.  **Man is headed for judgment** (Hebrews 9:27 – man dies once and
        then judgment; 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9 – eternal destruction for
        those who do not know God and disobey the gospel)/the wages of
        sin is death (Romans 6:23)/hell

    3.  **Substitutionary death of Christ – the just for the unjust** –
        1 Peter 3:18/ Romans 5:8 – Christ died for us while we were
        sinners/Isaiah 53:6, 11 – Yahweh caused the iniquity of us all
        to fall on Him … My Servant will justify the many, as He will
        bear their iniquities.

    4.  **Works are useless** – Ephesians 2:8-9

    5.  **You must confess Christ as Lord** – Romans 10:9

6.  Things to Consider When Witnessing

    1.  Know the message

    2.  Pray for salvation for others; that their hearts might be opened
        – Rom 10:1; Eph 1:18

    3.  Pray for an open door and clear speaking – Col. 4:3-4

    4.  Pray that God would give you the words – Eph 6:19

    5.  Use the Word of God – Hebrews 4:12 (sword); 2 Tim. 3:15
        (Scripture leads to salvation)

    6.  Share your testimony – very powerful; no one can argue with it –
        make sure your life matches it

    7.  Elicit a response – ask if the person is willing to turn from
        their sin and to Christ; ask if they are wiling to embrace
        Christ as Lord

    8.  Practical

        1.  Be a good listener

        2.  do not become defensive

        3.  don’t argue

        4.  don’t be pushy

        5.  do not move beyond their understanding

        6.  if you do not know something – say you don’t and find out

        7.  know your message and stay on it.

        8.  Christ is the focus.

HANDOUT – Bridge – urge them to review on their own – very helpful in
providing a systematic way to witness to someone
