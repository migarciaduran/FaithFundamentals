Notes taken from Biblical Doctrine (MacArthur/Mayhue) – pages 264-265,
272-272

**<u>Jesus Christ</u>**:

- One person, two natures.

- Two natures without confusion, without change, without division,
  without separation

- The deity of Christ is undiminished; the humanity of Christ is
  unexalted

- Called “hypostatic union” – two distinct natures united in one person

  - Divine nature – exactly as the Father

  - Human nature – exactly like man, but without sin

- Received His human nature at the Incarnation

- Each nature has its own will:

  - John 17:24 (divine) vs. Matthew 26:39 (human)

  - Luke 2:47 (divine) vs. Luke 2:51-52 (human)

- Jesus experienced human life, but without sin or a sinful nature, in a
  wide variety of situations.

- First public event in Jesus’ ministry reveals both divine and human
  natures – His baptism (Matthew 3:15):

  - Jesus identified with humans/sinners in baptism

  - Jesus had His Messiahship confirmed directly by the Father – Matthew
    3:17.

- Isaiah 9:6, 7 – references to His whole person; both natures essential
  (Matthew 1:21; Hebrews 4:14).

- References to His whole person that focus on divine attributes – John
  2:23-25; 3:13; 5:17.

- References to His whole person that focus on humanity – Matthew 4:1-2;
  Luke 2:7; Luke 2:40; John 4:6.
