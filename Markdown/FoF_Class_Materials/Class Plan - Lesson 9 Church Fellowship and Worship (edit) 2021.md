FOF Lesson 9 – Church Fellowship and Worship 2021

### Introduction

Today, we are going to continue our look at another of the more
practical elements in the class. That is, church fellowship and worship.
We will primarily consider the church; its leadership; its purposes and
functions; how we are to interact with one another; and, we will
consider some points regarding the worship of God.

### Church Universal

## Definition

> The church is not an organization, a bunch of buildings, programs and
> activities, a corporation, etc. It is a living organism, the Body of
> Christ, a fellowship that includes all believers seeking individual
> growth and focusing on ministry.

## The Believer’s Relationship to God and each other

1.  We are Children of God

> <u>John 1:12</u> – But as many received Him, to them **<u>He gave the
> right to become children of God</u>**, even to those who believe in
> His name.
>
> Who is being spoken of here in John 1? - Jesus
>
> What are those who receive Christ and believe in His name? – children
> of God

2.  We are brothers of Christ

> <u>Hebrews 2:11</u> – For both He who sanctifies and those who are
> sanctified are all from one Father; for which reason **<u>He is not
> ashamed to call them brethren</u>**.
>
> Who is He? – Jesus
>
> Who do believers share in common with Jesus? – one Father
>
> Who does that mean Jesus is with respect to the believer? – our
> brother

3.  We are brothers and sisters of each other

> <u>1 Corinthians 7:15</u> – Yet if the unbelieving one leaves, let him
> leave; **<u>the brother or the sister</u>** is not under bondage in
> such cases, but God has called us to peace.

Context – Christian is married to an unbeliever (i.e., person became a
Christian after they were married), then if the unbeliever wants to
leave, let him or her go.

> What words are used to describe the believing spouse? – brother or
> sister
>
> What does that mean believers are relative to one another? –
> brothers/sisters

### Local Church

## Structure – Who is in charge?

1.  Elders

    1.  Appointment

<u>Acts 14:23</u> – **<u>When they had appointed elders for them in
every church</u>**, having prayed with fasting, they commended them to
the Lord in whom they had believed.

Context – Paul and Barnabas in Galatia. They founded a number of
churches in that area.

What did they do in these churches? – appoint elders

In some of the churches? – no, every church

So, what does that mean each church should have? - elders

2.  Qualifications **HANDOUT** – don’t cover - 1 Tim. 3:1-7; Titus
    1:6-9 - **READ**

3.  Responsibilities

    1.  Rule

<u>1 Timothy 5:17</u> – **<u>The elders who rule well</u>** are to be
considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard at
preaching and teaching.

What is a function of elders? – rule the church; preach; teach

2.  Shepherd the Flock/Give Oversight

<u>1 Peter 5:1-2</u> – Therefore, **<u>I exhort the elders</u>** among
you, as your fellow elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a
partaker also of the glory that is to be revealed, **<u>shepherd the
flock of God among you, exercising oversight</u>** not under compulsion
but **<u>voluntarily, according to the will of God; and not for sordid
gain, but with eagerness</u>**

What is Peter’s exhortation to the elders? – shepherd the flock

What does a shepherd do? – OPEN – watches out for sheep; exercise
oversight

How? – voluntarily; according to the will of God; not for sordid gain;
with eagerness

2.  Deacons

    1.  Definition

<u>Acts 6:2-4</u> – So the twelve summoned the congregation of the
disciples and said, “It is not desirable for us to neglect the word of
God in order to **<u>serve tables</u>**. Therefore, brethren,
**<u>select from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the
Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may put in charge of this task</u>**. But
we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.”

Context – early church; apostles speaking as one group

What did the apostles say it was not desirable for them to do? – serve
tables

Why? – they needed to devote themselves to prayer and preaching/teaching

Generally, what does that mean? – those who preach and teach should
devote most of their time to preaching and teaching

What did they say to do? – appoint men to serve in the church

Qualifications? – good reputation; full of the Spirit and of wisdom

2.  Qualifications – pretty much same as elders – 1 Timothy 3:8-13

> **HANDOUT** – Difference pertains to teaching (QUIZ).

3.  Members and their Responsibilities

    1.  Submit to the Elders

<u>Hebrews 13:17</u> – **<u>Obey your leaders and submit to them</u>**,
for they keep watch over your souls as those who will give an account.
**<u>Let them do this with joy and not with grief</u>**, for this would
be unprofitable for you.

What is the command to believers? – obey the leaders and submit to them

Who are the leaders? – elders

Why? – they watch over us and will be held to an account for our souls,
and we want them to be able to watch over us with joy and not grief.

So, we need to submit to the elders in the church – do you?

2.  Practice the One Anothers – **HANDOUT** (we’ll look at later)

3.  Come to Church Regularly

<u>Hebrews 10:24-25</u> - let us consider how to stimulate one another
to love and good deeds, **<u>not forsaking our own assembling
together</u>**, as is the habit of some, but **<u>encouraging one
another</u>**; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.

What is the habit of some believers? – forsaking our own assembling
together

What does that mean? – they are not coming to church; they are not
involved in the fellowship.

Why do we assemble together? – stimulate to love and good works;
encourage one another

Why do you come to church? – Is it to impress people, to feel spiritual,
or to stimulate one another to love and good works; encourage one
another?

## Spiritual Duties of the Church

> <u>Acts 2:42</u> – They were continually devoting themselves to the
> apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to
> prayer.
>
> What four things did the early church continually devote themselves
> to? – apostles’ teaching; fellowship; breaking of bread (Lord’s
> Table); prayer
>
> Was it occasional? – No; they continually devoted themselves to those
> things.
>
> What about you – are you devoted to those things? Any of them?

### Fellowship

## Definition – OPEN – To share in something with someone else.

## Fellowship with Other Believers

> <u>1 John 1:7</u> – if we walk in the Light as He Himself is in the
> Light, **<u>we have fellowship with one another</u>**, and the blood
> of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.
>
> Who is “we” that walk in the Light? – believers

As believers, what do we have with one another? – fellowship

## Impossible to have with unbelievers

> <u>2 Corinthians 6:14-15</u> - Do not be bound together with
> unbelievers; for **<u>what partnership have righteousness and
> lawlessness</u>**, or **<u>what fellowship has light with
> darkness</u>**? Or **<u>what harmony has Christ with Belial</u>**, or
> **<u>what has a believer in common with an unbeliever</u>**?
>
> What are believers commanded to avoid? – being bound to an unbeliever
>
> What four phrases are used to show the *incompatibility* of believers
> and unbelievers?
>
> Can we have true fellowship with an unbeliever? – no
>
> Why not? – we have nothing in common with them.

## Practical

> I will just tell you, in the interest of time, that true fellowship
> requires unity – unity of mind and heart, and unity on key points of
> doctrine. To achieve that unity requires humility, love, and diligence
> in preserving that unity.
>
> To look at this see: 1 Corinthians 1:9-10; Ephesians 4:2-3;
> Philippians 1:27
>
> From a practical standpoint, we must consider the One Anothers -
> HANDOUT
>
> FOCUS ON SEVERAL, IF TIME – John 13:34; Philippians 2:3; Colossians
> 3:9
>
> We are commanded to practice these things in our daily lives. Are you?

### Worshipping God

Now, as we fellowship with God in prayer, in Communion, otherwise, as we
seek God, that should cause us to behold our great and awesome God, and
it should drive us to worship Him for who He is and what He has done for
us.

1.  **Definition** – OPEN – ascribing worth/value; bowing down; paying
    homage

> <u>Exodus 34:8</u> – Moses made haste to **<u>bow low toward the earth
> and worship</u>**. (Moses worshipping God for renewing the covenant
> with Israel and replacing the tablets on which the 10 Commandments
> were written)
>
> What does this verse tell us about worship? – it entails reverence;
> awe; homage

## Solely for God

> <u>Exodus 20:4-6</u> - "**<u>You shall not make for yourself an
> idol</u>**, or any likeness of what is in heaven above or on the earth
> beneath or in the water under the earth. **<u>You shall not worship
> them or serve them</u>**; for **<u>I, the LORD your God, am a jealous
> God</u>**, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on
> the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me, but showing
> lovingkindness to thousands, to those who love Me and keep My
> commandments.

What are the prohibitions in the second commandment? – don’t make an
idol; don’t worship or serve an idol

> Why not? – God is a jealous God
>
> What does that mean? – He wants our full attention; He doesn’t want us
> wandering off
>
> What kind of idols can we make? – OPEN
>
> What kind of idols do you have in your life?

## True Worship

1.  From the Heart

> <u>Matthew 15:8-9</u> – THIS PEOPLE HONORS ME WITH THEIR LIPS, BUT
> **<u>THEIR HEART IS FAR AWAY FROM ME</u>**. BUT **<u>IN VAIN DO THEY
> WORSHIP ME</u>**, TEACHING AS DOCTRINES THE PRECEPTS OF MEN.
>
> Context – Jesus rebuking the religious leaders of Israel for their
> heartless, ritualistic worship.
>
> What is the basis of Jesus’ rebuke? – the Jews’ hearts were not
> devoted to God; it was mechanical worship
>
> What is the result of that type of worship? – it is in vain; waste of
> time
>
> Is your worship mechanical and distracted, or is it focused on God?

2.  In Spirit and Truth

> <u>John 4:24</u> – God is Spirit, and **<u>those who worship Him must
> worship in spirit and truth</u>**.
>
> How must we worship God? – in spirit and truth
>
> Is that the Holy Spirit? – No.
>
> What does it mean to worship in spirit? – from the heart; proper heart
> attitude; not ritualistic and mechanical
>
> What does it mean to worship in truth? – consistent with Scripture
> (Nadab/Abihu)
>
> This is why it is so important to understand God’s attributes – so we
> can understand who He is, and understand who it is that we are
> worshipping.

3.  Gives God Glory

> <u>1 Corinthians 10:31</u> – Whether, then, you eat or drink or
> **<u>whatever you do, do all to the glory of God</u>**.
>
> What is the motivation for whatever we do? – the glory of God
>
> Is that only in some of the things we do? – no, all things

What are some ways we can glorify God? – OPEN.

> 1 Corinthians 6:18-20 – not sinning with our bodies
>
> 2 Corinthians 4:15 – people spreading the gospel
>
> Philippians 2:9 – people confessing Christ
>
> Do you bring glory to God through your life?

So, believers are part of the spiritual organism called the body of
Christ. As members of the body of Christ, we need to assemble into local
churches in order to fellowship with one another and serve one another.
We are to submit to the leadership of that local church. We are also
called to remember Christ’s death for us through the decree of
communion, and to worship God together and through our lives.
