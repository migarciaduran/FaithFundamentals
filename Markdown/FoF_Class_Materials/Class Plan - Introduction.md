FOF Class – Introduction

**Welcome** – Welcome to FOF; identify myself and Maria

Look forward to an enriching time in God’s Word for the next 22 weeks or
so

PLEASE TURN OFF ALL CELL PHONES, PAGERS, ETC.

Before we get started, I just want to read a few verses from the Bible
that kind of highlight what this class is about:

> <u>Colossians 1:28-29</u> – We proclaim Him, admonishing every man and
> teaching every man with all wisdom, so that we may present every man
> complete in Christ. For this purpose also I labor, striving according
> to His power, which mightily works within me.

## Class Format

1.  13 Lessons – in workbook

2.  Class will last ~22 weeks

#### Homework – ~1-3 hours per week (doing assignment in workbook; listening to the message on CD/from GTY – <https://www.gty.org/library/fundamentals>; verse memorization)

4.  Lessons from workbook – to be handed in and graded; please write
    legibly

5.  In-class quizzes

    1.  **for my use** – to determine what level the class is so that I
        can more effectively prepare for class

    2.  **given the week before** the lesson to be taught

    3.  **don’t guess** – if you do not know, that is OK – just leave it
        blank – if you guess, and guess correctly, I will not know to
        cover the material because I will think you know it

    4.  we will review parts of the quizzes when lesson is taught

6.  In-class format – **interactive** – I will not be preaching – I want
    you all to participate – you will retain more that way, and it will
    be more fun for all of us. **Please ask questions also**. We will
    also take prayer requests sometimes.

7.  Come to class on time – Maria and I will be here early, and we would
    be glad to speak with you individually if you have questions,
    concerns, etc. I will wind up the lessons at ~10:00 a.m. so that we
    can have a few minutes after class before the second service should
    you have any questions, etc.

8.  Memory Verses – each week we will have memory verses – Why?

> **ASK FOR READERS**:

1.  <u>Psalm 119:11</u> – “Your word I have treasured in my heart that I
    may not sin against you.”

2.  <u>Colossians 3:16</u> – “Let the word of Christ richly dwell within
    you”

3.  Let the Word fill your mind and your heart; submit to it; let it
    guide your life

## Materials Needed for Class

1.  Bible – church uses NASB, which we will use in the class; other good
    versions: KJV, NKJV, NIV, ESV. If you have a version other than
    these, you may want to consider purchasing a version that is more of
    a literal translation so that what you have is more faithful to the
    original Hebrew and Greek

2.  Lesson Workbook – available here or in bookstore

3.  Paper and something to write with

**POTLUCK** – Saturday May 19? – take survey.

## Course Goals – PUT ON BOARD AS WE DISCUSS – recap as you go through

> <u>Four Goals</u>: (1) the assurance of eternal life;
>
> \(2\) to become equipped for ministry
>
> \(3\) to strengthen our love for God’s laws (obedience)
>
> \(4\) to develop a more intimate relationship with God

### The Assurance of Eternal Life

> <u>1 John 5:11-13</u> – 11 And the testimony is this, that **<u>God
> has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son</u>**. 12
> **<u>He who has the Son has the life</u>**; he who does not have the
> Son of God does not have the life. 13 These things I have written to
> you who believe in the name of the Son of God, **<u>so that you may
> know that you have eternal life</u>**.
>
> According to verse 13, what can we know? – that we have eternal life
>
> FYI – anytime you see “so that” in your Bible, it means “for the
> purpose that”
>
> According to verse 12, who has eternal life? – he who has the Son
>
> According to verse 13, what does it mean to have the Son? – to believe
> in the name of the Son of God, Jesus.
>
> What does it mean to believe in the name of Jesus? – to submit to the
> Lordship of Christ, to obey Christ, and to have faith that Jesus’
> death on the Cross paid your sin debt to God.
>
> Do you ***know*** that you have eternal life?
>
> So, one of the goals of this class is to give you a deeper assurance
> that we who believe in Christ, and all that He is, will have
> everlasting life with Him in heaven.

### To Become Equipped for Ministry

1.  **To be Adequate for Every Good Work**

> <u>2 Timothy 3:16-17</u> – 16 All Scripture is inspired by God and
> profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in
> righteousness; 17 so that the man of God may be **<u>adequate</u>**,
> **<u>equipped for every good work</u>**.

“adequate” – to equip fully, thoroughly furnish

“equipped” – presence of everything needed for a designated purpose

So, another goal of this class is to thoroughly furnish you with
everything you need to engage in good works, which according to
Ephesians 2:10 is what believers in Christ are predestined for.

2.  **To be Equipped for Service in the Body of Christ**

> <u>Ephesians 4:11-12</u> – 11 And **<u>He gave</u>** some as
> **<u>apostles</u>**, and some as **<u>prophets</u>**, and some as
> **<u>evangelists</u>**, and some as **<u>pastors</u>** and
> **<u>teachers</u>**, 12 **<u>for the equipping of the saints for the
> work of service, to the building up of the body of Christ</u>**

Who is “He”? – verse 7 – Christ

> Who has Christ given the church? – apostles, prophets, evangelists,
> pastors, teachers
>
> Why did Christ give these people to the church? – to equip the saints
>
> Who are these saints? – believers in Christ (Romans 8:26-27)
>
> What are the saints being equipped for? – the work of service
>
> What service? – building up of the Body of Christ, the church (1 Cor.
> 12:12-27)
>
> Who is to do this service? – the saints; us; not the pastors, etc.
>
> So, another goal of this class is to equip you, to thoroughly furnish
> you, to serve in the church.
>
> Do you want to be better equipped to serve? Do you even want to serve?

3.  **To be Able to Share our Faith**

> <u>1 Peter 3:15</u> – but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts,
> **<u>always being ready to make a defense to everyone who asks you to
> give an account for the hope that is in you</u>**, yet with gentleness
> and reverence
>
> What does this verse say we should be ready to do? – to make a defense
> to anyone who asks for the hope that is in us
>
> What is hope? – Greek – *elpis* (el-peace) – a favorable and confident
> expectation; a forward look with assurance/confidence
>
> What is the hope within us? – that after we die we will be resurrected
> to eternal life (Acts 24:15 (apostle Paul before Felix a Roman
> governor in Judea– “having a hope in God, which these men cherish
> themselves, **<u>that there shall certainly be a resurrection of</u>**
> both <u>the righteous</u> and the wicked”)
>
> So, another goal of the class is to equip you to share and defend your
> faith as Paul did
>
> So far, we have learned that the goals of this class are to:

1)  give you assurance of eternal life, and

2)  to equip you for ministry by:

    1)  thoroughly furnishing you for good works

    2)  thoroughly furnishing you for service in the Body of Christ, and

    3)  giving you the tools to share and defend your faith.

3.  **To Strengthen Our Love for God’s Laws (Obedience)**

    1.  **The Example of the Psalmist**

> <u>Psalm 119:159-165</u> – 159 **<u>Consider how I love Your
> precepts</u>**; Revive me, O LORD, according to Your lovingkindness.
> 160 **<u>The sum of Your word is truth</u>**, And **<u>every one of
> Your righteous ordinances is everlasting</u>**. 161 Princes persecute
> me without cause, But **<u>my heart stands in awe of Your words</u>**.
> 162 **<u>I rejoice at Your word, As one who finds great spoil</u>**.
> 163 **<u>I hate and despise falsehood</u>**, But **<u>I love Your
> law</u>**. 164 **<u>Seven times a day I praise You, Because of Your
> righteous ordinances</u>**. 165 **<u>Those who love Your law have
> great peace, And nothing causes them to stumble</u>**.
>
> What did the Psalmist love? – God’s precepts
>
> What is a precept? – a commandment, instruction, or rule
>
> What does the Psalmist say God’s word is? – truth
>
> What is an ordinance? – a law
>
> How does the Psalmist describe God’s ordinances? – righteous,
> everlasting
>
> What is the Psalmist’s attitude toward God’s word? – he rejoices in
> it, as if he found great treasure
>
> What does the Psalmist hate and despise? – falsehood (note he said the
> Word was truth)
>
> What does the Psalmist say he loves in verse 163? – God’s law
>
> What does the Psalmist do in view of God’s righteous ordinances? –
> praises God seven times a day!!
>
> What are the benefits of loving God’s law? – they have great peace and
> they do not stumble
>
> How do we show our love for God? – we keep His commandments (John
> 14:21)

So, another goal of this class is to strengthen our love for God’s laws
and increase our desire to obey His laws, rejoice in His Word, and
praise Him frequently for His Word.

> To recap, we have learned that the goals of this class are to:

1)  give you assurance of eternal life, and

2)  to equip you for ministry by:

    1)  thoroughly furnishing you for good works

    2)  thoroughly furnishing you for service in the Body of Christ, and

    3)  giving you the tools to share and defend your faith.

3)  To strengthen your love for God’s law and your desire to obey His
    law

### To Develop a More Intimate Relationship with God

> <u>Exodus 33:13</u> – "Now therefore, **<u>I pray You</u>**, if I have
> found favor in Your sight, **<u>let me know Your ways that I may know
> You</u>**, so that I may find favor in Your sight."
>
> What was Moses doing? - praying
>
> What did Moses desire? – to know God’s ways and to know God, not just
> knowing *about* God, but to know God
>
> What does it mean “to know”? – Hebrew – *yada* - to know, comprehend,
> understand
>
> Can we know God? – Yes! – <u>John 17:3</u> – Jesus, in His high
> priestly prayer to God the Father said “This is eternal life,
> **<u>that they may know You</u>**, the only true God, and Jesus Christ
> whom You have sent.”
>
> What is Jesus praying? – that we may know God and Christ
>
> As our knowledge of God increases, our worship will become deeper and
> truer.
>
> What were both Moses and Jesus doing when they expressed a desire that
> we know God? – they prayed.
>
> What does that mean we should be praying for? – to know God more
> deeply.
>
> Do you want to know God more deeply? – God will be on display in this
> class.
>
> So, another purpose of this class is to provide us with a deeper
> knowledge of God.
>
> To recap, we have learned that the goals of this class are to:

1)  give you assurance of eternal life, and

2)  to equip you for ministry by:

    1)  thoroughly furnishing you for good works

    2)  thoroughly furnishing you for service in the Body of Christ, and

    3)  giving you the tools to share and defend your faith.

3)  To strengthen your love for God’s law and your desire to obey His
    law

4)  to provide us with a deeper knowledge of, and more intimate
    relationship with, God

<u>Results</u>: (1) assurance of eternal life … we do not doubt our
salvation

\(2\) to become equipped for ministry … to share and defend our faith

\(3\) to strengthen our love for God’s Law … obedience

## Navigator’s Wheel – ties the lessons together – HANDOUT (if time)

> The Navigators are an evangelistic group on college campuses and
> military bases
>
> **The Wheel illustrates the Christian life** – Christ is the center of
> the Christian’s life directing it and empowering it, and the obedient
> Christian is in the Word / in prayer / in fellowship with other
> Christians / and witnessing to non-Christians

#### Christ – the Center of our lives

1.  **Keep your eyes fixed on Jesus**

> <u>Hebrews 12:2</u> – **<u>fixing our eyes on Jesus</u>**, the author
> and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the
> cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the
> throne of God
>
> What are we commanded to do? – fix our eyes on Jesus – fix – Greek –
> *aphoraō* – to concentrate one’s gaze upon.
>
> What do you think that means?
>
> Are your eyes fixed on Jesus? Is Christ the center of your life? Is He
> the most important priority to you?

We will cover the God-head in lessons 3-7 in great detail

#### The Obedient Christian

1.  **Obedience is a mark of true believer**

> <u>1 John 2:4-5</u> – 4 The one who says, "I have come to know Him,"
> and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in
> him; 5 **<u>but whoever keeps His word, in him the love of God has
> truly been perfected</u>**
>
> How do you know that you have come to know Christ? – you keep His
> commandments
>
> What does John say about the one who claims to know Christ but does
> not keep Christ’s commandments? – he is a liar and the truth is not in
> him.
>
> <u>John 14:15</u> – If you love Me, you will keep My commandments
>
> How do we show our love for Christ? – obedience to His commandments
>
> Are you living in obedience to the Word? Do you know what God wants
> you to do?

We will look at obedience and the will of God in Lessons 12 and 13.

#### The Bible – God’s Word

1.  **The Bible is God’s Word**

> How do we know what God wants us to do? – look in the Word
>
> How does God communicate to us? – through His Word
>
> <u>2 Timothy 3:16-17</u> – 16 **<u>All Scripture is inspired by
> God</u>** and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction,
> for training in righteousness; 17 so that the man of God may be
> adequate, equipped for every good work.
>
> What does this passage say Scripture is? – inspired by God; inspired
> means – breathed out; all Scripture is “God-breathed”
>
> How much of Scripture is God breathed? – all of it

2.  **Scripture Can Bring One to Salvation**

> <u>2 Timothy 3:15</u> – that from childhood you have known **<u>the
> sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to
> salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus</u>**
>
> What are the Scriptures, the sacred writings able to do? – lead one to
> salvation through faith in Christ Jesus

3.  **Scripture causes us to grow**

> <u>1 Peter 2:2</u> – like newborn babies, **<u>long for the pure milk
> of the word</u>**, **<u>so that by it you may grow in respect to
> salvation</u>**
>
> What are we to long for? – the Word of God
>
> Why? – that we may grow spiritually

4.  **The Bible is Filled with God’s Commandments**

> Exodus 20 – the Ten Commandments
>
> Also, Ephesians 4 and 5/ Colossians 3/ 1 Thessalonians 5

We will look at the Bible in great detail in Lessons 1 and 2.

#### Prayer

1.  **We are commanded to pray**

> <u>Ephesians 6:18</u> – With all prayer and petition **<u>pray at all
> times</u>** in the Spirit, and with this in view, be on the alert with
> all perseverance and petition for all the saints
>
> Is prayer optional for a Christian? – No
>
> How often are we to pray? – at all times
>
> <u>1 Thessalonians 5:17</u> – “pray without ceasing”
>
> <u>Colossians 4:2</u> – “devote yourselves to prayer”
>
> We will look at prayer in detail in Lesson 8

#### Fellowship

1.  **Fellowship with God**

> <u>1 John 1:3</u> – what we have seen and heard we proclaim to you
> also, **<u>so that you too may have fellowship with us</u>**; and
> indeed **<u>our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus
> Christ</u>**
>
> What does this verse say that we can have? – fellowship with each
> other and with God
>
> What is fellowship with each other ? – summarized by “one anothers” in
> the NT – we will study in Lesson 9
>
> What is fellowship with God? - God’s love for us; God helping us bear
> our burdens; Christ and the Holy Spirit interceding for us;
> reconciliation with God; God’s disciplining us; God’s exhorting us;
> God’s encouraging us

2.  **Fellowship with each other**

> <u>Hebrews 10:24-25</u> – 24 and let us consider how to stimulate one
> another to love and good deeds, 25 **<u>not forsaking our own
> assembling together, as is the habit of some</u>**, but encouraging
> one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near

What does this passage we are not to do? – forsake our assembling
together

> Do you have fellowship with other believers? Are you practicing the
> one-anothers?
>
> We will look at that subject in Lessons 9 and 10.

#### Witnessing

> <u>1 Peter 2:9</u> – But you are A CHOSEN RACE, A royal PRIESTHOOD, A
> HOLY NATION, A PEOPLE FOR God's OWN POSSESSION, **<u>so that you may
> proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness
> into His marvelous light</u>**

Do you realize that we who are chosen as believers are chosen to
proclaim Christ?

> Are you telling others about Christ?
>
> Do you know how to do that?
>
> Is your life a positive witness for Christ? Do you know how to explain
> the gospel?

We will look at the subject of witnessing and evangelism in Lesson 11.
