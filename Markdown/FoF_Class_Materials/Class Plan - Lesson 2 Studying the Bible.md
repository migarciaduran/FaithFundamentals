FOF Class – Lesson 2

Studying the Word of God

Mention that they should read questions in workbook carefully and try
not to just regurgitate verses where the questions are for what a
response should be or why are the verses important.

# Introduction

Our overall goal today will be to encourage you to read and study the
Bible, and to teach you some basic skills for studying the Bible.

> We will talk about:

1.  Why study the Bible?

2.  General and Practical Means of Studying the Bible

3.  Specific Bible Study Tools

4.  Practice on a passage

# Why we study the Bible?

## Page 16 of Lesson has examples – HAVE CLASS <u>READ</u> THEM OFF

## Prepares Us for Service 

> <u>1 Timothy 4:6</u> – In pointing out these things to the brethren,
> **<u>you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, constantly nourished
> on the words of the faith</u>** and of the **<u>sound doctrine</u>**
> which you have been **<u>following</u>**.
>
> **Context** - Paul is writing to Timothy about those who fall away
> from the faith and advocate false doctrine. He then says that
> everything that is of God and received with gratitude is good. Paul
> then says that Timothy will be a good servant of Christ if he points
> out these things to the brethren.
>
> What does Paul call Timothy? – a good servant of Christ
>
> What two things does Paul equate to being a good servant? – (1) being
> constantly nourished on the words of the faith and (2) following sound
> doctrine
>
> What is “the faith”? – the Christian faith
>
> What are the “words of the faith”? – the word of God
>
> So, in order to be good servants, what do we need to do? – nourish
> ourselves on the Word and follow sound doctrine
>
> *Are you nourishing yourselves on the Word*?
>
> *Are you living your lives according to sound doctrine*?

## It is God’s Will

> <u>Joshua 1:8</u> – This **<u>book of the law</u>** shall not depart
> from your mouth, **<u>but you shall meditate on it day and
> night</u>**, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is
> written in it; for then you will make your way prosperous, and then
> you will have success
>
> What does the word “shall” indicate? – this is a command
>
> Is this something God is merely suggesting? – no – it is His will
>
> What shall we meditate on? – book of the law (extent of the Word at
> that time)
>
> How often shall we meditate on the Word? – day and night
>
> *Are you meditating on the Word day and night*?
>
> <u>Colossians 3:16</u> - Let the word of Christ richly dwell within
> you.
>
> What are we commanded to do? – let the Word richly dwell
>
> What does it mean “to dwell within you”? – to live in us
>
> How do we get the Word in us? – read, study, meditate, memorize

## To Know God More Deeply

### Jesus Christ

> <u>John 5:39</u> – You search the Scriptures because you think that in
> them you have eternal life; it is these that testify about Me.
>
> What do the Scriptures do? – testify about Christ
>
> What should we do if we want to know Christ better? – read the Word
>
> **Do you want to know Christ better**?

## Application

> Do you spend time in God’s word? Every day?
>
> How much do you know about God?
>
> How well do you know God?
>
> Are you living a holy life before God?

# Practical Means of Knowing the Bible

## Hearing

### Preaching in Church

> <u>2 Timothy 4:1-2</u> – **<u>I solemnly charge you in the presence of
> God and of Christ Jesus</u>**, who is to judge the living and the
> dead, and by His appearing and His Kingdom: **<u>preach the
> word</u>**; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke,
> exhort, with great patience and instruction.
>
> What does Paul tell Timothy to do? – preach the Word
>
> What is the significance of Paul saying that he charged Timothy in the
> presence of God and Christ? – this is serious
>
> If Paul is commanding Timothy to preach the Word, what does this
> imply? – that someone will be there to hear it
>
> <u>Nehemiah 8:1-8</u> – **READ** – And all the people gathered as one
> man at the square which was in front of the Water Gate, and they asked
> Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses which the Lord
> had given to Israel. Then Ezra the priest brought the law before the
> assembly of men, women, and all who could listen with understanding,
> on the first day of the seventh month. He read from it before the
> square which was in front of the Water Gate from early morning until
> midday, in the presence of men and women, those who could understand;
> and all the people were attentive to the book of the law. Ezra the
> scribe stood at a wooden platform which they had made for the purpose.
> And beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and
> Maaseiah on his right hand; and Padaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum,
> Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam on his left hand. Ezra opened
> the book in the sight of all the people for he was standing above all
> the people; and when he opened it, all the people stood up. Then Ezra
> blessed the Lord the great God. And all the people answered, ‘Amen,
> Amen!’ while lifting up their hands; then they bowed low and worshiped
> the Lord with their faces to the ground. Also, Jeshua, Bani,
> Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita,
> Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, the Levites, explained the law to
> the people while they remained in their place. They read from the
> book, from the law of God, translating to give the sense so that they
> understood the reading.
>
> Do you see the prominence given to reading and teaching of the Word?
>
> Do you see the reverence people had for the reading of the Word?

### Radio – KKLA

### CD’s/internet – lots of this on the Internet – I can recommend

### **Need for Discernment** – lots of erroneous teaching out there

> <u>2 Peter 3:16-17</u> – as also in all his \[Paul’s\] letters,
> speaking in them of these things, in which are some things hard to
> understand, **<u>which the untaught and unstable distort, as they do
> also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own destruction</u>**. You
> therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, **<u>be on your guard so
> that you are not carried away by the error of unprincipled men and
> fall from your own steadfastness</u>**.
>
> Whose writings is Peter referring to here? – Paul’s letters
>
> What does he say some do with them? – distort them
>
> What is the result of their distorting Scripture? – destruction
>
> What is Peter’s exhortation to his readers? – be on your guard against
> those who distort the Word
>

> fall away from the faith
>
> <u>Acts 17:11</u> – Now these were more noble-minded than those in
> Thessalonica, for they received the word with great eagerness,
> **<u>examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things were
> so</u>**.

## Reading 

### Chapters at a time – flow/context

### Examples:

1.  Bible in a Year (MacArthur Daily Bible) – many options

2.  Pastor MacArthur – read small letters (e.g. 1 John) or divide larger
    books into about four sections (e.g., John) and read each for one
    month – you will know it after one month

3.  Me – I like to spend a month going through a short book, and maybe
    two or three months going through larger books

## Studying

1.  not putting God first

2.  not saved

3.  no self-discipline

4.  no plan

5.  no accountability

6.  too busy

7.  lazy

3.  have a quiet place where you can get away from the busy-ness

4.  set goals – read Bible in a year; study certain books of the Bible

## Memorizing – Why memorize Scripture?

### **To Defeat Sin and Temptation**

> <u>Psalm 119:11</u> – Your word I have treasured in my heart, that I

## Meditating

### Why meditate on God’s Word?

1.  Brings Blessing

> <u>Psalm 1:1-3 (great to memorize BTW)</u> – **<u>How blessed is the
> man who</u>** does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand in
> the path of sinners, nor sit in the seat of scoffers! But **<u>his
> delight is in the law of the Lord, and in His law he meditates day and
> night</u>**. He will be like a tree firmly planted by streams of
> water, which **<u>yields its fruit</u>** in its season and its leaf
> does not wither; and **<u>in whatever he does, he prospers</u>**.
>
> Who is this Psalm talking about? – a blessed man
>
> Why is this man blessed? – he does not walk in the counsel of the
> wicked, stand in the path of sinners, sit in the seat of scoffers,
> BUT, he delights in the law of the Lord, and in God’s law he meditates
> day and night.
>
> What is the result? – fruit, prosperity
>
> <u>Joshua 1:8</u> – This **<u>book of the law</u>** shall not depart
> from your mouth, **<u>but you shall meditate on it day and
> night</u>**, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is
> written in it; **<u>for then you will make your way prosperous, and
> then you will have success</u>**
>
> We have looked at this passage before, and noted that meditating on
> the Word brings prosperity and success, *spiritually*.

### What is meditation on God’s Word?

1.  prayerful pondering with a goal towards understanding and applying

2.  it is not emptying our minds – Hindu, mystical concept

## Studying the Bible Requires Discipline and Diligence

> <u>2 Timothy 2:15</u> – JUST READ – **<u>Be diligent</u>** to present
> yourself approved to God as a <u>workman</u> who does not need to be
> ashamed, **<u>accurately handling the word of truth</u>**.

# Specific Bible Study Tools - Hermeneutics

> Hermeneutics are rules for properly interpreting the Bible
>
> <u>Key Points</u>:

1.  All Scripture agrees

2.  Interpret Scripture in light of Scripture

3.  Look at the historical and Scriptural context – both immediate and
    more distant

4.  Interpret literally

5.  No preconceived ideas – exegesis vs. eisegesis.

# Actual Bible Study

## Preparation – How do we prepare ourselves to study the Bible?

### **Put Aside Sin, Put on Humility**

> <u>James 1:21</u> – Therefore, **<u>putting aside all filthiness and
> all that remains of wickedness</u>**, **<u>in humility receive the
> word implanted</u>**, which is able to save your souls.
>
> To receive the word, what two things must we do? – (1) put aside all
> filthiness/wickedness (confess sin); (2) humble ourselves before the
> Word

### **Pray for Understanding**

> <u>Psalm 119:18</u> – Open my eyes, that I may behold wonderful things
> from Your law.
>
> What do we need to pray for when we open the Word? – that God would
> open our eyes to the wonderful things in His Word

What does it mean to open our eyes? – give us understanding

> **3. Set our Heart to Study**
>

# Practice (if time)

<u>Titus 3:3-7</u> – For we also once were foolish ourselves,
disobedient, deceived, enslaved to various lusts and pleasures, spending
our life in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another. But when the
kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appeared, He saved
us, not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but
according to His mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewing by
the Holy Spirit, whom He poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ
our Savior, so that being justified by His grace we would be made heirs
according to the hope of eternal life.
