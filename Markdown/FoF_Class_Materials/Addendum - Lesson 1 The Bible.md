# The Inspiration of the Bible

> What does “inspiration” of the Bible mean? - OPEN
>
> **<u>Inspiration</u>** – involves God overseeing and directing men to
> write His words. God initiates the process and works through men,
> without compromising their individual personalities and vocabularies,
> to produce divinely inspired writings.
>
> *Theopneustos* (Gr.) – literally means “God-breathed.” *Theos* – God;
> *pneo* – to breathe – used in 2 Timothy 3:16 to indicate that all
> Scripture is God-breathed.
>
> \*\*So, *revelation* is God revealing Himself to us; *inspiration* is
> how He did it!\*\*
>
> Do you believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of God?

## Divine Sovereignty

1.  **God is in total control of all things (including His Word)**

> <u>Isaiah 46:10</u> (God speaking through the prophet Isaiah) –
> Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things
> which have not been done, saying, ‘**<u>My purpose will be
> established, and I will accomplish all My good pleasure</u>**.”
>
> Whose purpose will be established? – God’s
>
> What will God accomplish – **<u>all</u>** His good pleasure
>
> Who is in control of all things? – God

2.  **God will preserve His Word**

> <u>Isaiah 40:8</u> – The grass withers, the flower fades, but **<u>the
> word of our God stands forever</u>**.
>
> What does Isaiah say “stands forever”? – the Word of God
>
> As opposed to what? – the grass and flowers, which wither and fade

3.  **God is protective of His Word**

> <u>Deuteronomy 4:2</u> – **<u>You shall not add to the word which I am
> commanding you, nor take away from it</u>**, that you may keep the
> commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.

What does Moses warn the Israelites about? – adding to or taking away
from the Word.

> <u>Revelation 22:18-19</u> – 18 I testify to everyone who hears the
> words of the prophecy of this book; **<u>if anyone adds to them, God
> will add to him the plagues which are written in this book</u>**; 19
> and **<u>if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this
> prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life and from
> the holy city, which are written in this book</u>**.
>
> What will happen if one adds to or takes away from the Word of God? -
> consequences; punishment; indicative of no salvation.
>
> What is the significance of the last few verses in the last book of
> the Bible containing such warnings? – serious warning against
> tampering with the Word of God; in fact, God has preserved His Word in
> numerous internally consistent manuscripts for 2000 years. This
> indicates that God wanted His truths accurately preserved so that His
> truths would last forever.
>
> Practically speaking, what should we do if we encounter someone who
> claims to “have the Word of God”? – test what He says against the
> Bible to make sure that it is consistent with the Bible. If not, such
> a claim should be rejected.
>
> **So, we can see God’s sovereignty over all things, including the
> preservation and protection of His Word.**

## The Holy Spirit Witnesses to the Inspiration of Scripture

1.  **The Holy Spirit, through the Word, leads men to salvation and a
    transformed life**

> <u>Romans 10:17</u> – **<u>faith comes by hearing</u>** and
> **<u>hearing by the word of Christ</u>**
>
> What leads to faith? – hearing
>
> Hearing what? – the word of Christ; the word about Christ

2.  **The Holy Spirit, through the Word, convicts and judges our
    thoughts and hearts**

> <u>Hebrews 4:12</u> – For **<u>the word of God is living and active
> and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the
> division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to
> judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart</u>**.

What is living and active? – the Word of God

> What does it mean to pierce to the division of soul and spirit and
> joints and marrow? – the truths of the Word of God can penetrate us at
> the deepest possible level
>
> What does the Word of God judge? – thoughts and intentions of our
> heart?
>
> What does that mean? – the Word is the standard by which our hearts
> and minds are judged; the Word convicts us of sin.
>
> Is your life, including your thoughts, intentions, and motivations,
> submitted to the Word of God? OR, are you ignoring what you know to be
> the teachings of Scripture??

3.  **The Holy Spirit enables us to know the things of God**

> <u>1 Corinthians 2:11-12</u> – 11 For who among men knows the thoughts
> of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so
> **<u>the thoughts of God no one knows except the Spirit of God</u>**.
> 12 Now **<u>we have received</u>**, not the spirit of the world, but
> **<u>the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely
> given to us by God</u>**.
>
> Who is the only One who knows the thoughts of God? – the Holy Spirit

What does the Holy Spirit do in those who have received Him by
salvation? – enables us to know the things of God

> **So, the Holy Spirit testifies to the inspiration of Scripture by
> leading men to salvation through the Word, convicting us of sin
> through the Word, and enabling us to know the Word.**

#### C. The Bible Claims to be the Word of God

1.  **All Scripture is God-breathed**

<u>2 Timothy 3:16</u> – \[a\]ll Scripture is inspired by God.

How much Scripture is inspired by God? – all of it

<u>2 Peter 1:20-21</u> – 20 know this first of all, that **<u>no
prophecy of Scripture is a matter one’s own interpretation</u>**, 21
**<u>for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will</u>**,
**<u>but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God</u>**.

How much Scripture was made by an act of human will? - none of it.

How was Scripture made? - men moved by the Holy Spirit

Can Scripture mean whatever we want it to mean? - No.

Scripture is not a matter of what? - one's own interpretation.

We will see this more in Lesson 2, but Scripture is not subject to
personal interpretation/meaning -- Scripture means what God intended it
to mean through the original authors, to the original audiences. One
meaning – one or more applications.

> **2. The Bible Claims to be The Word of God**
>
> The Bible itself indicates that it is God’s Word over 2,000 times with
> phrases such as “**<u>God said …</u>**” (Genesis 1:3, 6:3; Exodus
> 16:4; Acts 9:15; Acts 18:9) and “**<u>The word of the Lord …</u>**”
> (Acts 8:25, 11:16, 12:24, 13:48; 1 Thessalonians 4:15; 1 Peter 1:25).

3.  **Jesus Christ Confirmed that the OT was God’s Word**

<!-- -->

1.  **Jesus’ Temptation by Satan**

> <u>Matthew 4:1-11</u> – Jesus Christ quoted from the OT to resist
> Satan’s temptations (Deuteronomy 8:3, 6:16, 6:13) – said “it is
> written”

### 4. NT Writers Believed That They Were Writing God’s Word

> There are also many other statements in the NT that affirm the fact
> that the writers of the NT believed that they were writing the very
> words of God.
>
> <u>1 Corinthians 14:37</u> – \[i\]f anyone thinks he is a prophet or
> spiritual, let Him recognize that **<u>the things which I write to you
> are the Lord’s commandment</u>**
>
> How did Paul refer to the things that he wrote to the Corinthians? –
> as a commandment from the Lord
>
> <u>See also</u>: 2 Corinthians 12:17; Galatians 1:11-12; 1
> Thessalonians 2:13, 4:15
>
> **So, in a number of instances, Paul believed his message to be the
> Word of God.**

### 5. Other Instances of Inspiration

<u>1 Timothy 5:18</u> – Paul refers to Luke 10:7 as “Scripture”

<u>2 Pet. 3:15-16</u> – Peter regards Paul’s letters as Scripture

<u>John 12:50</u> – Jesus indicates that He spoke the word of God

**So, the Bible claims to be the Word of God by: (1) explicitly making
that claim (2 Timothy 3:16; “The Lord says…”); (2) Christ confirming the
OT; (3) numerous parallel passages between the OT and NT in which God
speaks; (4) NT writers believing that they were writing God’s Word**

**<u>Summary</u>**: we believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of
God because: (1) God’s sovereignty; (2) the Holy Spirit’s witness; (3)
the explicit claims of the Bible; and, (4) the New Testament writers
affirming that the OT and what they wrote was God’s Word

# Believability of the Bible

What evidences are there that the Bible is true, accurate, and
ultimately, believeable?

## Historical Accuracy

> Archaeology has confirmed a number of biblical details – For
> interesting reading on this topic –
> <http://www.christiananswers.net/archaeology/home.html>

####### The Flood - The fossil record confirms that there was a worldwide flood about 4,500-5,000 years ago.

## Internally Consistent – 40 writers/66 books written in 3 languages over 1600 years; BUT, no errors or contradictions!!!

## Scriptures Confirmed by Christ

1.  **Confirms Jews' Rejection of Christ, as Predicted** – Psalm 118:22

> <u>Mark 12:10</u> – Have you not even read **<u>this Scripture</u>**:
> ‘the stone which the builders rejected, This became the chief corner
> stone.’

2.  **Confirms Burning Bush Event** – Exodus 3:6

> <u>Mark 12:26</u> – “But regarding the fact that the dead rise again,
> **<u>have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the
> burning bush</u>**, how God spoke to him saying, ‘I am the God of
> Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?’”
>
> Other: <u>Matthew 10:15</u> – Sodom and Gomorrah; <u>Matthew 12:40</u>
> – Jonah in the belly of the whale; <u>John 6:49</u> – manna to the
> Jews during the Exodus
>
> **In each of these instances, Christ refers back to the OT and
> indicated He believed them, confirmed them, and rebuked people for not
> reading/knowing the Scriptures.**

## Scripture is Life-Changing

> The Bible has dramatically changed millions of lives for thousands of
> years.
>
> <u>Example in Scripture</u> - <u>Acts 16:14</u> – A woman named Lydia,
> from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple fabrics, a worshiper of
> God, was listening \[to what Paul was teaching\]; and the Lord opened
> her heart to respond to **<u>the things spoken by Paul</u>**.

## Prophetic Accuracy (most powerful) 

1.  **Birthplace of the Messiah – prophesied in Micah 5:2 (700 years
    before Christ); fulfilled in Luke 2:4-7**

2.  **Virgin Birth of the Messiah – prophesied in Isaiah 7:14 (700 years
    before Christ); fulfilled in Matthew 1:18-25**

3.  **Triumphal Entry – prophesied in Zech 9:9 (500 years before
    Christ); fulfilled in John 12:12-15**

4.  **Christ’s Crucifixion – prophesied in Psalm 22 (1000 years before
    Christ); fulfilled in John 19**

5.  **Christ’s Suffering**

> **Prophecy (700 years before Christ)**: <u>Isaiah 53:4-7</u> – 4
> Surely our griefs He Himself bore, And our sorrows He carried; Yet we
> ourselves esteemed Him stricken, Smitten of God, and afflicted. 5 But
> **<u>He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was crushed for
> our iniquities</u>**; The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him,
> And **<u>by His scourging we are healed</u>**. 6 All of us like sheep
> have gone astray, Each of us has turned to his own way; But the LORD
> has caused the iniquity of us all To fall on Him. 7 He was oppressed
> and He was afflicted, **<u>Yet He did not open His mouth; Like a lamb
> that is led to slaughter, And like a sheep that is silent before its
> shearers, So He did not open His mouth</u>**.
>
> **Fulfillment**:
>
> <u>Matthew 26:63</u> – (fulfills Isaiah 53:7) - But **<u>Jesus kept
> silent</u>**. And the high priest said to Him, ‘I adjure You by the
> living God, that You tell us whether You are the Christ, the Son of
> God.’
>
> How did Jesus respond to those who accused Him? – silence
>
> <u>2 Corinthians 5:21</u> – **<u>He made Him who knew no sin to be sin
> on our behalf</u>**, so that we might become the righteousness of God
> in Him
>
> What did God make Jesus? – sin; a sin offering on our behalf
>
> What portions of Isaiah 53 does this relate to? – pierced, crushed,
> caused iniquity of us all to fall on Him
>
> <u>1 Peter 2:24</u> – and **<u>He Himself bore our sins in His body on
> the cross</u>**, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness;
> **<u>for by wounds you were healed</u>**.
>
> What did Jesus bear in His body on the Cross? – our sins
>
> What do we gain by His wounds? – we are healed
>
> Does this sound like physical healing? – No (context)
>
> What kind of healing does this sound like? – spiritual healing
>
> What does this tell us about Jesus’ work on the Cross? – atoned for
> our sins, healed us spiritually, restored us to well-being
>
> Have you embraced for yourself Jesus’ work on the Cross?

## Summary

> So, we can believe what the Bible says because:

1.  It is historically accurate

2.  It is internally consistent

3.  It was confirmed by Christ

4.  It is life-changing, and has proven to be over time

5.  It contains numerous fulfillments of prophecy
