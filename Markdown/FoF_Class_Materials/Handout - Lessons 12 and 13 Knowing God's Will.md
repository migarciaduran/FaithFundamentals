KNOWING GOD’S WILL

It is critical that we know what God’s will is for any meaningful
decision of life (job, home, marriage, etc.). Simply having a “sense of
peace” about some decision is insufficient. Our subjective peace is
influenced by our fallen nature, which can easily rationalize a given
decision to produce a sense of peace and convince us that the decision
we made was God’s will. Jeremiah 17:9 states that “the heart is more
deceitful than all else and is desperately sick.” In Hebrew, the word
for heart is *lêb* (labe), which is not merely the heart, but the will,
intellect, motives, feelings, and affections. In other words, our will,
intellect, motives, feelings, and affections are deceitful and sick and
cannot be trusted because of our sinful nature.

This handout describes two approaches to knowing what God’s will is for
a particular decision. One approach is more theological in nature, while
the other is more practical. The theological approach is from John
MacArthur’s book “<u>Found: God’s Will</u>.” The practical approach is
from Charles Stanley’s book “<u>Handbook of Christian Living</u>.”

<u>Theological Approach</u>:

The theological approach to knowing whether something is God’s will
requires that the we are: (1) saved; (2) filled with the Spirit; (3)
morally pure; (4) submitted to those in authority over him or her (God,
government, church leaders); and, (5) prepared to suffer for Christ. If
these criteria are each present in us, then we can do whatever we want
because what we want will be in conformity with God’s will.

**First**, salvation is a prerequisite for being within God’s will.
God’s will is for “all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of
the truth.” (1 Timothy 2:4). If we are not saved, we are not within
God’s will, and we would have no reason to believe that any decision we
make would be within God’s will. Those who are saved will follow God’s
will because they are led by their Shepherd and recognize the voice of
their Shepherd. (John 10:4). Contrary to the “natural man,” we who are
saved “have the mind of Christ,” and know what His will is for us. (1
Corinthians 2:14-16). Thus, in order to have the mind of Christ such
that we know what His will is, as well as having the ability to follow
our Shepherd (and thus, to know and do His will), we must be saved.

**Second**, being filled with the Spirit is a condition for knowing
whether or not something is within God’s will. We are commanded to
understand what God’s will is, and to be filled with the Spirit.
(Ephesians 5:17-18). Being filled with the Spirit is akin to letting
“the word of Christ dwell richly within us.” Notably, the command in
Ephesians 5:18 to “be filled with the Spirit” is properly translated,
based on the tense of the Greek verb, *plēroō*, “be being kept
continuously filled with the Spirit.” It is a command to believers to
constantly and continuously on a moment-by-moment basis to be filled
with the Spirit. The best way to understand the command to be filled
with the Spirit is to look to Colossians 3:16, which states “\[l\]et the
word of Christ richly dwell within you.” The command to “be filled with
the Spirit” and to “let the word of Christ richly dwell within you” are
two sides of the same coin, as evidenced by the substantially similar
results of each as set forth in Ephesians 5:18-6:9 and Colossians
3:16-25. In other words, to “be filled with the Spirit” is to
continuously know, yield to, submit to, obey, and do the Word of God.
And, this is the continuing duty of all believers at all stages of their
lives. Believers who are filled with the Spirit can be said to “walk by
the Spirit” (Galatians 5:16), and in doing so, they receive the “fruit
of the Spirit,” one of which is peace. (Galatians 5:22-23). So, to have
true peace over a decision because we know it is God’s will, we must be
filled with the Spirit – that is, completely filled with, and submitted
to, His Word.

**Third**, to know that we are within God’s will, we must be pure. If we
are not keeping God’s will, how can we expect God to show us His will.
First Thessalonians 4:3-7 states: “For this is the will of God, your
sanctification; that is, that you abstain from sexual immorality; that
each of you know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and
honor, not in lustful passion, like the Gentiles who do not know God;
and that no man transgress and defraud his brother … For God has not
called us for the purpose of impurity, but in sanctification.” There are
four very clear commands here: (1) that we abstain from sexual
immorality (v. 3); (2) that we control our bodies to make sure that we
use them and dress them in a way that honors God (v. 4); (3) that we
subdue our passions and refrain from acting in a godless manner (v. 5);
and, (4) that we treat others fairly and honestly (v. 6). The
overarching principle is stated in verse 7 – that God has not called us
to impurity, but sanctification and growth in Christ-likeness. Here, the
principle is clear, if we are living within God’s revealed will in all
areas of our lives, we can be confident that the decisions we make are
also within God’s will.

**Fourth**, another aspect of knowing whether or not decisions we make
are within God’s will involves whether or nor we are submitted –
submitted to God, to government, to church leaders, and to employers. We
are commanded to submit to the Lordship of Christ (Matthew 17:5; John
3:36; Romans 14:9); we are commanded to submit to government authorities
(Titus 3:1; 1 Peter 2:13-15); we are commanded to submit to church
leaders (Hebrews 13:17); and we are commanded to submit to our bosses
(Titus 2:9; 1 Peter 2:18). God calls us to submit to authorities and
employers, in particular, so that we stand out in the world, so that we
can reach the world, and so that we can be salt and light in the world.
(Matthew 5:13-16). If our lives do not demonstrate a pattern of
submissiveness, there is a significant likelihood that we will not be
submitted to God in matters of personal decisions such as the choice of
a career. Therefore, in order to have confidence that a decision we make
is within God’s will, our lives should be models of submissiveness.

**Fifth**, the final aspect of the “theological” approach to determining
whether we are within God’s will in a particular decision is to make
sure that we are prepared to suffer for Christ. We are called to suffer
for Christ. (Matthew 5:10-11 – “Blessed are those who have been
persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of
heaven. Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and
falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Me.”; 1 Peter 3:17
– “it is better, if God should will it so, that you suffer for doing
what is right rather than for doing what is wrong”; <u>see also</u>, 1
Peter 4:12-19; 1 Peter 5:10). If we are unwilling to suffer for Christ,
we are in sin and have no reason to believe that anything we decide will
be within the will of God. In other words, if we decide against a
particular option (a certain job, for instance) because it will involve
suffering for Christ, we can be assured that such a decision is not
within God’s will. We must be willing to suffer for Christ, and being so
will give us confidence that the decisions we make are within God’s
will.

Now, if points one through five are operative in our lives, we can do
whatever we want because we know that our decisions are rooted and
grounded in God’s Word and that whatever we choose to do will be within
God’s will, as well, including the choice of a career or the like. We
are “to present our bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to
God, which is \[our\] spiritual service of worship.” (Romans 12:1). We
are also commanded to “not be conformed to this world, but be
transformed by the renewing of \[our\] mind\[s\], so that \[we\] may
prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and
perfect.” (Romans 12:2). In other words, our very decisions and actions
are to be holy acts of worship to God. We are commanded to be
transformed by the renewing of our minds (by being filled with the
Spirit and letting the word of Christ richly dwell within us). If we are
diligent in doing these things, our minds, hearts, and lives will be
transformed and the actions that we want to take (whether it be who to
marry or a job to take) will reflect our transformation and conformity
to Christ’s image. This is the crux of the “theological” approach to
knowing God’s will. If we are saved, and attend to our being filled with
the Spirit, abiding in the Word, living a submitted life, and being
prepared to suffer, our decisions will be within the will of God.

It would be incongruous for a saved, Spirit-filled, sanctified,
submitted, prepared-to-suffer for Christ person to all of a sudden
completely depart from such a lifestyle and make a decision to become a
bookie, a professional gambler, a prostitute, or the like. It just would
not make sense. If such a person were to make such a crazy decision, it
would call into question whether any of points one through five were
operative in his or her life. So, if we are saved, Spirit-filled,
sanctified, submitted, prepared-to-suffer for Christ people, we can be
confident that the choices we make will be God-honoring choices that
will produce peace within us.

<u>Practical Approach</u>:

The practical approach to knowing whether something is God’s will
requires that we examine: (1) whether the path we desire to take is
consistent with God’s moral will; (2) whether it is consistent with the
principles in God’s word (such as the law of sowing and reaping); and,
(3) whether or not taking the path we desire would be wise considering
the present circumstances of our lives.

**First**, we can know if a decision we make is within God’s will if it
is consistent with the moral will of God – God’s moral commands to us in
Scripture. God’s moral will is revealed throughout the Bible, and it is
not a difficult matter to determine whether a decision is within God’s
moral will. (See e.g., Exodus 20:3-17; Matthew 5:3-12; Ephesians
4:17-5:12; Colossians 3:5-14).

John 14:21 states that “He who has My commandments and keeps them is the
one who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I
will love him and will disclose Myself to him.” In other words, we show
our love for Christ by keeping His commandments, and if we are obedient,
the Father and Christ will love us, and Christ will reveal Themselves to
us. As it pertains to knowing God’s will, how could a loving God who has
revealed Himself to us lead into something that contradicts His
commandments that we are commanded to obey? He cannot. From our
viewpoint, how could we believe that something would be God’s will if it
contradicts His commandments to us? That simply would not make sense.
God wants to have an intimate relationship with us, and our side of that
intimacy requires obedience. So, we will have a difficult time
discerning His will for us if we neglect His moral will. For example, if
a Christian were trained as a doctor, and is striving to obey God’s
moral will, he or she should not have any hesitation rejecting a job at
a medical clinic that performs abortions. So, God’s will for us will not
include anything that conflicts with His moral will.

**Second**, God’s will in a particular decision for us will be
consistent with the principles in His Word. God’s principles are not
direct statements of His moral will, but are more like cause and effect
rules. These principles are found, for example, in Proverbs 11:24 –
“There is one who scatters, and yet increases all the more, and there is
one who withholds what is justly due, and yet it results only in want.”
The principle is that what we cling tightly to will diminish, and things
that we scatter and give will be multiplied and returned.

Another principle is found in Galatians 6:8 – “the one who sows to his
flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the
Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.

While we are making decisions, God’s principles will likely come to bear
on our decision. It is imperative that we spend regular time in the Word
of God so that these principles are in our minds and will be drawn out
by the Spirit at the proper time so that they can direct our
decisionmaking.

**Third**, we can know that something is God’s will if it is a wise
decision in view of the current circumstances in our lives. This is the
particularly practical element of this approach. In Ephesians 5:15, we
are commanded to “be careful how you walk, not as unwise men but as
wise.” Certainly, a wise thing to do before considering this prong of
the test is to ask in faith for wisdom from God. (James 1:5-8). For
every decision that we make, we need to consider whether it is a wise
decision. To consider whether or not something is wise, we must consider
our current circumstances in light of God’s Word, and not just make
decisions blindly based on self.

<u>Conclusion</u>:

We must submit our decisions in life to God’s Word. There is not one way
to do that, as shown in this handout. But, it is imperative that God’s
Word serve as the authority for our decisions in life. If we are able to
use God’s Word in this manner, our decisions will improve, we will act
in a manner that is pleasing and glorifying to God, and we will have
true peace over our decisions.
