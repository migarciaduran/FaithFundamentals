Lesson 8 - Prayer

### Introduction

Today and next week, we are going to discuss prayer. Specifically, we
will discuss:

1)  what prayer is;

2)  the purposes of prayer;

3)  how we are to pray;

4)  does prayer work?

5)  Does God want us to pray to Him?

We will learn that:

1)  prayer is our personal communication with God;

2)  we pray because:

> \(a\) it is a command of Scripture and it is sinful not to pray
>
> \(b\) it glorifies God
>
> \(c\) it aligns our will with God’s will
>
> \(d\) we want the prayer answered

3)  the proper way to pray is:

> \(a\) in accordance with God’s will
>
> \(b\) consistent with the person and purposes of Christ
>
> \(c\) with an obedient heart
>
> \(d\) from a place of abiding in Christ
>
> \(e\) not for selfish things
>
> \(f\) with importunity
>
> \(g\) by presenting a case for answering to God.

\(4\) prayer works

\(5\) God indeed wants us to pray to Him.

**HANDOUT** – FOF Prayer Star (How to Pray?)

### Prayer is our personal communication with God

> <u>Daniel 9:4</u> – **<u>I prayed to the LORD my God</u>** and
> confessed and said, "Alas, O Lord, the great and awesome God, who
> keeps His covenant and lovingkindness for those who love Him and keep
> His commandments
>
> Context – prayer by the prophet Daniel regarding the fulfilling of
> Jeremiah’s prophecy about the length of Israel’s captivity in Babylon
>
> Who did Daniel pray to? – God
>
> Was there any intermediary? – No
>
> What are some of the characteristics in this prayer? – awe, adoration,
> confession of sin, statement of God’s grace to those who are obedient
>
> <u>Matthew 6:7-8</u> – And when you are praying, **<u>do not use
> meaningless repetition as the Gentiles do</u>**, for they suppose that
> they will be heard for their many words. So do not be like them; for
> **<u>your Father knows what you need before you ask Him</u>**.
>
> Who is talking here? – Jesus
>
> Who is He talking to? – disciples; a lot of people – Sermon on the
> Mount
>
> What is He talking about? – prayer
>
> What does He say not to do when you pray? – using meaningless
> repetition
>
> Why does He say this? – the Father knows what we need before we ask
> Him
>
> One point before we move on – The Lord’s Prayer can be prayed, but it
> is not really something we should memorize to pray often. It is a
> model for prayer – Jesus in Matthew 6:9 says “Pray then in this way”;
> He did not say memorize and repeat these words.

## What about if we have a desire to pray, but don’t even know what to say?

> <u>Romans 8:26-27</u> – In the same way the Spirit also helps our
> weakness; **<u>for we do not know how to pray as we should, but the
> Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for
> words</u>**; and He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the
> Spirit is, because **<u>He intercedes for the saints according to the
> will of God</u>**.
>
> When we don’t know what to pray for, who helps us? – the Spirit
>
> How does He help us? – He intercedes to God for us with deep groanings

So, we pray directly to God. We approach him in awe, adoration, praise,
confession, and humility. We do not use meaningless repetition in our
prayers. If we do not know what to pray for, we are blessed to have the
Holy Spirit praying to God for us.

### What are the Purposes of Prayer? Why do we pray?

#### It is a command of Scripture and it is sinful not to pray

> **<u>Ephesians 6:18</u>** – **<u>With all prayer and petition pray at
> all times</u>** in the Spirit, and with this in view, **<u>be on the
> alert</u>** with all **<u>perseverance</u>** and petition for **<u>all
> the saints</u>**
>
> What does this verse command? – prayer and petition
>
> How often are we to pray? – at all times (note: perseverance)
>
> Who are we to pray for? – the saints
>
> What do you think the reference to being on the alert means? – be
> sensitive and alert for reasons to pray and people to pray for
>
> How often do you pray?
>
> **<u>Colossians 4:2</u>** – **<u>Devote</u>** yourselves to prayer,
> **<u>keeping alert in it</u>** with an **<u>attitude of
> thanksgiving</u>**
>
> What does this verse command? – devote ourselves to prayer
>
> What does “keeping alert in it” mean? – attentiveness to others’ needs
>
> What other characteristic is commanded here? – pray with thanksgiving
>
> When you pray, do you give thanks to God?
>
> **<u>Psalm 50:15</u>** – **<u>Call upon Me</u>** in the day of
> trouble; **<u>I shall rescue you</u>** and you will honor Me.
>
> Who is speaking here? – God (v. 1, 7)
>
> What does He command us to do? – call upon Him
>
> When? – in the day of trouble.
>
> What does He promise in response? – He will rescue us
>
> What are we then to do? – praise and honor Him.
>
> How will your prayer life change as a result of these verses?

#### It glorifies God

> **<u>John 14:13</u>** – Whatever you ask in My name, that will I do,
> **<u>so that the Father may be glorified in the Son</u>**.
>
> <u>Note</u>: asking in Jesus’ name means asking for things that are
> consistent with who He is and what His purposes are – we will address
> this in more detail later.

Who is speaking here? – Jesus (v. 9)

What is it that glorifies the Father? – answered prayer

How do you think answered prayer glorifies God? – it is God’s
opportunity to

> show us His goodness and glory

#### It aligns our will with God’s will

> **<u>Matthew 6:10</u>** – **<u>Your will be done</u>** on earth as it
> is in heaven

Context – Jesus is teaching the disciples how to pray

> What does Jesus say should be included in the content of our prayers?
> – a request for God’s will to be done
>
> Do you pray in accordance with God’s specifically revealed will? (use
> my own example of praying through Colossians 3:1-3)
>
> How will this change your prayer life?

#### For Answers

> **<u>James 5:16</u>** – The effective (**<u>energetic) prayer of a
> righteous man can accomplish much</u>**.
>
> <u>Note</u>: the word translated “effective” in the NASB is from the
> Greek word *energeō*, which is better translated “energetic.” So, this
> verse better reads, “the energetic prayer of a righteous man can
> accomplish much.”
>
> What does it mean that prayer “can accomplish much”? – that it will be
> answered
>
> What type of prayer can accomplish much? – energetic
>
> From what type of person must prayer that can accomplish much come
> from? – a righteous man
>
> What does it mean to be righteous? – saved, obedient, no unconfessed
> sin
>
> So, the energetic prayers of saved, obedient sinners who have
> confessed their sins will be answered.

### How are we to Pray? – HANDOUT

###### In accordance with God’s will

> **<u>1 John 5:14-15</u>** – This is the **<u>confidence</u>** which we
> have before Him, that, if we **<u>ask anything according to His
> will</u>**, He hears us. And if we know that He hears us in whatever
> we ask, **<u>we know that we have the requests which we have asked
> from Him</u>**.
>
> How we are to pray? – in accordance with God’s will
>
> What do we know we have if we ask according to God’s will? – what we
> asked for
>
> How do we know what God’s will is? – the Word, His attributes;
> sometimes we do not know
>
> What is the result if we ask according to His will? – the Lord hears
> us
>
> And what is the result if He hears us? – we will have what we have
> asked for
>
> What should that give us with respect to prayer? – confidence
>
> Putting this all together, what do these verses mean? – if we pray in
> accordance with God’s will, our prayers will be answered.
>
> **<u>Matthew 26:39</u>** – And He went a little beyond them, and fell
> on His face and prayed, saying, "My Father, if it is possible, let
> this cup pass from Me; **<u>yet not as I will, but as You will</u>**."
>
> What does the “cup” refer to? – the wrath that God was about to pour
> out on Jesus
>
> What does Jesus pray for? – that the wrath would be taken away (that
> He would not have to suffer)
>
> BUT, What is the qualifier to Jesus’ prayer? – that the Father’s will,
> not His would be done
>
> What attributes of Christ’s humanity are exhibited in this prayer? –
> fear, anxiety, submission, humility
>
> What does this say about how we are to pray? – it must be in humility
> and in accordance with God’s will
>
> What about people who believe we can pray for whatever *we* want and
> get it? – they are wrong

###### Consistent with the person and purposes of Christ

> **<u>John 14:13-14</u>** - **<u>Whatever you ask in My name, that will
> I do</u>**, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. "**<u>If
> you ask Me anything in My name, I will do it</u>**

Who is speaking? (v. 9) – Jesus

What does He say is a basis for answered prayer? – asking in His Name

Who are we to ask? (v. 14) – Jesus (we can pray to Jesus)

> Is asking in Jesus name merely a mantra to be added to our prayers? –
> No
>
> What is the significance of “name”? – it embodies all that a person is
>
> So, what does it mean to ask in Jesus’ name? – to ask for things that
> are consistent with the person and work of Jesus Christ
>
> So, what should we focus on in our prayers? – the person, purposes,
> and work of Jesus Christ
>
> How have you been praying in this regard? Do you just tack on an “in
> Jesus’ name” at the end, or do you seriously contemplate whether your
> prayers are consistent with His name?
>
> How can you improve your prayer life?

###### With an obedient heart

> **<u>1 John 3:22</u>** – **<u>whatever we ask we receive from Him,
> because we keep His commandments</u>** and **<u>do the things that are
> pleasing in His sight</u>**

What are the two conditions for answered prayer in this verse? – (1)
keeping God’s commandments and (2) doing things that are pleasing in His
sight

> What is another word for keeping God’s commandments and doing things
> that are pleasing in His sight? – obedience
>
> <u>Note</u>: “keep” and “do” are present tense verbs in the Greek –
> indicates continuing action, not a one-time event; a pattern of
> obedience in our lives
>
> Putting this all together, what does this mean? – that answered prayer
> requires an pattern of obedience in our lives.
>
> **<u>Psalm 66:18</u>** – If I regard wickedness in my heart, the Lord
> will not hear.
>
> What causes the Lord not to hear us? – wickedness in our hearts

###### From a place of abiding in Christ

> **<u>John 15:7</u>** – If you **<u>abide in Me</u>**, and **<u>My
> words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for
> you</u>**
>
> Who is speaking here? (John 14:23) - Jesus
>
> What does “abide” mean? – dwell, remain, stay
>
> What does it mean to abide in Christ? – to dwell in His sufficiency
> and will, to lean on Him, to rely on His strength
>
> What does it mean for Christ’s words to abide in us? – they dwell in
> us, in our minds, and guide and control us (<u>read Colossians
> 3:16</u>)
>
> What is the consequence for prayer if we abide in Christ and His words
> abide in us? – answered prayer
>
> Why is that? – OPEN – if we are living consistently with who Christ
> is, in reliance on Him, and Christ’s words are controlling our lives,
> whatever we ask will be consistent with His will, and it will be done.

###### Not for selfish things – kind of the negative for all we have been discussing

> **<u>James 4:3</u>** – You ask and do not receive, **<u>because you
> ask with wrong motives</u>**, so that you may spend it on your
> pleasures
>
> What is a hindrance to answered prayer? – asking with wrong motives
>
> What is the wrong motive identified? – seeking things to spend for our
> pleasure
>
> What sins does this implicate as being a hindrance to prayer? –
> selfishness, greed, worldliness
>
> There are a lot of folks in so-called Christianity today that believe
> we can demand wealth and prosperity from God, but this is contrary to
> the teaching of Scripture.
>
> John MacArthur states that “prayer is sharing the needs, burden, and
> hunger of our hearts before our heavenly Father.” (MNTC, Matthew 1-7
> at p. 369). If our hearts are filled with a desire for money and
> things, we need to ask ourselves which master we are serving – God or
> money.

###### With importunity (persistent boldness)

> **<u>Luke 11:5-10</u>** – Then He said to them, "Suppose one of you
> has a friend, and goes to him at midnight and says to him, 'Friend,
> lend me three loaves; 6for a friend of mine has come to me from a
> journey, and I have nothing to set before him'; 7and from inside he
> answers and says, 'Do not bother me; the door has already been shut
> and my children and I are in bed; I cannot get up and give you
> anything.' 8"I tell you, even though he will not get up and give him
> anything because he is his friend, yet **<u>because of his persistence
> he will get up and give him as much as he needs</u>**. 9"So I say to
> you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock,
> and it will be opened to you. 10"For everyone who asks, receives; and
> he who seeks, finds; and to him who knocks, it will be opened.
>
> Context – this comes right after the Lord’s Prayer in Luke 11:2-4.
> This is an illustration by Jesus of yet *another important aspect of
> prayer*. Here, a man goes to a friend/neighbor at midnight and asks
> for three loaves because he had a friend come over and he had no food
> for him. The neighbor says that everything is locked up and the kids
> are in bed. Essentially, it would be a real hassle to get the man what
> he has requested.
>
> Why did the friend/neighbor give the man the three loaves? (v. 8) –
> persistence
>
> What is Jesus illustrating? (v. 9-10) – prayer
>
> What is Jesus teaching as a component of prayer? – persistence,
> boldness, importunity – to just persist with boldness in prayer
>
> Do you pray persistently and boldly?

###### By Presenting Your Case for Answering Your Prayer to God

> **<u>Job 23:3-4</u>** – Oh that I knew where I might find Him, that I
> might come to His seat! **<u>I would present my case before Him and
> fill my mouth with arguments</u>**.
>
> What is Job desiring to do here? – come before the Lord in prayer.
>
> Once there, how does he plan to pray? – presenting his case before
> God, with arguments (like a lawyer).
>
> What can we use as arguments? – OPEN (God’s attributes; God’s
> promises; God’s past acts; benefits to/relief to God’s people …).
>
> Do you pray like this?
>
> See Genesis 18:22-33 for another example of this. Exodus 32:11-14 as
> well.

### Does Prayer Work?

> **<u>Exodus 32:9-14</u>** – The LORD said to Moses, "I have seen this
> people, and behold, they are an obstinate people. 10"Now then let Me
> alone, that My anger may burn against them and that I may destroy
> them; and I will make of you a great nation." 11Then Moses entreated
> the LORD his God, and said, "O LORD, why does Your anger burn against
> Your people whom You have brought out from the land of Egypt with
> great power and with a mighty hand? 12"Why should the Egyptians speak,
> saying, 'With evil intent He brought them out to kill them in the
> mountains and to destroy them from the face of the earth'? **<u>Turn
> from Your burning anger and change Your mind about doing harm to Your
> people</u>**. 13"Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, Your servants to
> whom You swore by Yourself, and said to them, 'I will multiply your
> descendants as the stars of the heavens, and all this land of which I
> have spoken I will give to your descendants, and they shall inherit it
> forever.'" 14So **<u>the LORD changed His mind about the harm which He
> said He would do to His people</u>**.
>
> Who does “this people” refer to? – Israel

What is the Lord planning to do to Israel? – destroy them

Why? – stubborn, disobedient hearts

What is Moses’ response? – He prays to the Lord

What is Moses’ specific request? – that the Lord would change his mind
(v. 12)

> What are Moses’ two arguments to God (v. 12, 13)?

1)  Don’t give the Egyptians a reason to speak badly of You;

2)  Remember Your promise to multiply the descendants of Abraham, Isaac,
    and Jacob

> What does the Lord do? – He changed His mind (v. 14)
>
> What is this an example of? – answered prayer
>
> What elements of prayer that we have been talking about are present
> here? – according to God’s will (promise), obedient heart (God was
> going to make of Moses a great nation, so he must have been right with
> God), not selfish (same), boldness (asking God to change His mind),
> presenting his case with arguments before God (v. 12-13).

### God Wants You to Pray to Him and Wants to Answer You

> **<u>Luke 11:9-13</u>** – 9 “So I say to you, **<u>ask</u>**, and it
> will be given to you; **<u>seek</u>**, and you will find;
> **<u>knock</u>**, and it will be opened to you. 10 For **<u>everyone
> who asks, receives</u>**; and <u>he who seeks, finds</u>; and **<u>to
> him who knocks, it will be opened</u>**. 11 Now suppose one of you
> fathers is asked by his son for a fish; he will not give him a snake
> instead of a fish, will he? 12 Or if he is asked for an egg, he will
> not give him a scorpion, will he? 13 If you then, being evil, know how
> to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly
> Father give **<u>the Holy Spirit</u>** to those who ask Him?”
>
> What are the commands here? – ask, seek, knock.
>
> What do they mean? – pray to the Father – bring Him your
> needs/cares/concerns.
>
> Is God lightly suggesting that you come? No, it is a command. He wants
> you to come.
>
> Will God answer? – yes, subject to the other things we talked about.
>
> Will God answer your prayers with good things? – yes, the best. The
> Holy Spirit.
>
> Jeremiah 33:3; Psalm 50:15; Psalm 81:10b.
