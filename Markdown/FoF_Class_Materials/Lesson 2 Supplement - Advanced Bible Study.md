Fundamentals of the Faith – Lesson 2

How to Study the Bible?

Going to focus on the “study” part of the lesson.

<u>Pastor John (in workbook)</u> – “The ‘how’ of learning and applying
Scripture to life is something every Christian should know.”

Proverbs 2:4 tells us to search for understanding as a man searches for
treasure.

So, Bible study is not some casual thing we half-heartedly do; it is a
very serious thing that we have to do, and we have to work at and
improve at.

<u>Quote from workbook</u> – “Bible study is more than just reading the
Bible; it involves careful observation, interpretation, and application.
Reading gives you the overall picture, but study helps you think, learn,
and apply what you read to your life.”

  - <u>Advanced Resource</u>: *Toward an Exegetical Theology* by Kaiser

- **Actual Bible Study**

  - **Observation** – asking questions of the text (p. 19 of the
    workbook)

    - Start by extensively reading the passage

    - What is God saying?

    - How is he saying it?

    - What is involved in the passage?

    - Who is involved?

    - What is happening?

    - Where is it happening?

    - When is it happening?

    - Key words, people, subjects

    - Verb tenses (commands, warnings)

    - Repetition

    - Comparisons

  - **Interpretation** – determining the meaning of the text (p. 19-20
    of the workbook)

    - Overriding question – what is God intending to say (authorial
      intent)?

    - What is the significance of …?

    - What does a particular word mean? Why did the writer use it?

    - Names, phrases, dates

    - Context (verses immediately before and after; larger context)

      - We have four major gaps to bridge as we look for the intent of
        the author in what he is saying?

        - **Language** – Bible was not written in English – we have
          excellent, faithful interpretations, but sometimes the
          original languages present meanings that English does not
          completely capture

        - **Culture** – we must understand the culture to which a given
          book was written so that we can properly understand the intent
          of the author in writing what he wrote

        - **Geography** – knowing the geography in the Bible really
          opens up the Word – if you can, go to Israel; go to places
          referenced in the Bible

        - **History** – understanding history (kind of like we did in
          Lesson 1 with our overview of the Bible, looking at Israel’s
          history) helps our understanding of the Bible

    - Sentence structure

    - Grammar

    - Word studies (concordance, dictionary)

    - Cross-references (same word used in a different scripture –
      concordance)

    - Key interpretative principles

      - **Literal** – interpret the Bible literally in its natural
        sense; if symbolism is used interpret what is being symbolized
        literally

      - **Historical** – interpret the Bible in its historical context –
        what did the text mean to the people to whom it was written –
        How would the church in Philippi have understand the letter Paul
        wrote to them

        - Classic example of where this is butchered – Sermon on the
          Mount – a lot of people treat the Sermon on the Mount as
          simply great moral teaching for the ages, but they miss the
          whole point of the passage, which is that it is a description
          of the Christian (especially the Beatitudes) – a non-Christian
          cannot live that life because they do not have the Spirit of
          God living inside of them to empower and enable that kind of
          life.

      - **Grammatical** – understand the basic grammar of the original
        languages – to whom or what do words refer; what are the verb
        tenses

        - <u>Resource</u>: Zodhiates – *Key Word Study Bible*.

      - **Synthesis** – the Bible does not contradict itself; if our
        interpretation conflicts with another passage, our
        interpretation is wrong; we need to compare Scripture with
        Scripture to make sure the interpretation is correct

  - **Application** – putting the implications of the text into practice
    in your life

    - SPECS

      - Sin to forsake

      - Promise to claim

      - Example to follow

      - Command to obey

      - Stumbling block to avoid

- **Practice on Titus 3**
