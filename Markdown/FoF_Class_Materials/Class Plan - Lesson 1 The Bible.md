FOF Class- The Bible (Lesson 1)

Three Classes

### Opening Prayer

######## Reminder About Potluck – <span class="mark">August 5</span> – at our house; 3:00 p.m.

# Introduction

> What we will cover in the next three classes includes:

1.  General Information about the Bible – origins, titles, translations

2.  A Survey of the Bible

3.  The Inspiration and Believability of the Bible

# Origin of the Bible

> Here, we will be discussing how God revealed Himself to mankind. There
> are two types of revelation – (1) general, or natural revelation; and,
> (2) special revelation. We will first define “revelation,” and then we
> will look more closely at general and special revelation, the purposes
> of each, as well as the differences between the two.
>
> What is revelation? – the act of God whereby He discloses to man what
> would otherwise be unknowable.

## General Revelation

1.  **Creation**

> Context – the primary teaching of Romans 1-3 is that all men are
> sinful and fall short of the glory of God despite the fact that God
> has revealed Himself to us
>
> <u>Romans 1:18-20</u> – 18 For the wrath of God is revealed from
> heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress
> the truth in unrighteousness, 19 because that which is known about God
> is evident within them, for God made it evident to them. 20 **<u>For
> since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal
> power and divine nature have been clearly seen, being understood
> through what has been made</u>**, so that they are without excuse.
>
> How has God revealed Himself to man? – (v. 20) through what has been
> made
>
> What does creation show us about God? – (v. 20) His attributes, His
> eternal power, and His divine nature
>
> What is an attribute? – a characteristic
>
> Think about the endlessness of the universe – what attribute of God
> does that reveal? – His infiniteness (we are finite)
>
> Is God’s general revelation of Himself in creation something that is
> obscured to man? – No, it has been “clearly seen” – it is evident to
> all of us
>
> Where can we look to see general revelation? – nature, God’s provision
> of rain and abundant harvests

2.  **Conscience**

> <u>Romans 2:14-15</u> – 14 For when Gentiles, who do not have the Law
> do **<u>instinctively</u>** the things of the Law, these, not having
> the Law, are a law to themselves, 15 in that they show the work of the
> Law written in their hearts, **<u>their conscience bearing
> witness</u>** and their thoughts alternately accusing or else
> defending them.
>
> Based on verse 15, how has God also revealed Himself to us? – by
> giving us a conscience that *instinctively* tells us right from wrong.

3.  **Purpose of General Revelation**

> What is the purpose of general revelation? - OPEN
>
> \(1\) to reveal to man that God exists
>
> \(2\) to cause us to understand that God is a creator God

\(3\) to cause us to realize that we are not the highest being in the
universe, the center of the universe, the end-all be-all of everything –
God is

> **Can general revelation lead a person to salvation?** – No – it
> leaves us without excuse that there is a God who is supreme over us,
> but it does not provide enough information to lead one to God’s
> *appointed means* of salvation through repentance towards God and
> faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.

## Special Revelation

What is special revelation? – God revealing Himself to man by breaking
into man’s finite world.

1.  **Examples of Special Revelation**

    1.  **Theophanies – appearances of God in tangible form**

> <u>Genesis 17:1</u> – Now when Abram was ninety-nine years old,
> **<u>the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him</u>**, ‘I am God
> almighty; walk before Me, and be blameless.’
>
> <u>Genesis 26:2</u> – **<u>And the Lord appeared to him \[Isaac – v.
> 1\] and said</u>**, ‘Do not go down to Egypt; stay in the land of
> which I shall tell you.’
>
> Who appeared to both Abram (Abraham) and Isaac? – the Lord
>
> What constitutes the revelation? – the words spoken by the Lord

2.  **Dreams and Visions**

> <u>1 Kings 3:5</u> – In Gibeon, **<u>the Lord appeared to Solomon in a
> dream at night; and God said</u>**, ‘ask what you wish me to give
> you.’
>
> <u>Acts 14:9-10</u> – 9 **<u>A vision appeared to Paul in the
> night</u>**: a man of Macedonia was standing and appearing to him, and
> saying, ‘Come over to Macedonia and help us. 10 **<u>When he had seen
> the vision</u>**, immediately we sought to go into Macedonia,
> concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.

3.  **Miracles and Signs**

> What were some of the miracles God performed in the OT? - OPEN
>
> \(1\) the flood; (2) the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah; (3) the
> Egyptian plagues; (4) the parting of the Red Sea; (5) manna from
> heaven to feed the Israelites; (6) the destruction of the walls of
> Jericho

4.  **The Prophets**

> What is a prophet? – it is a person who speaks forth God’s Word, but
> not necessarily foretelling the future, as is commonly believed.
>
> Who are some of the prophets in the OT? – OPEN

5.  **Jesus Christ**

> Jesus Christ was the greatest prophet and special revelation in all
> history.
>
> <u>John 14:8-9</u> – 8 Philip said to Him \[Jesus\], ‘**<u>Lord, show
> us the Father</u>**, and it is enough for us.’ 9 Jesus said to Him,
> ‘Have I been so long with you, and yet you have not come to know Me,
> Philip? **<u>He who has seen Me has seen the Father</u>**; how can you
> say, ‘Show us the Father?’’
>
> What does Philip ask Jesus? – Show us God the Father
>
> What is Jesus’ response? – if you have seen Me, you have seen the
> Father
>
> What does that mean in terms of special revelation? – Jesus is the
> exact representation of the Father

6.  **The Bible**

> The entire Bible is special revelation – it is God’s Word revealed to
> us. This is where we will focus in this lesson.

2.  **Sufficiency of Special Revelation**

> Does special revelation reveal *everything* about God? – let’s look:
>
> <u>Deuteronomy 29:29</u> – **<u>The secret things belong to the Lord
> our God</u>**, but **<u>the things revealed belong to us and to our
> sons forever</u>**, that we may observe all the words of this law.
>
> Do we know *everything* about God? – No. Some things remain with God

How much do we know? – that which has been revealed by general
revelation, to our consciences, and in the Word of God

> Why has God revealed some things to us? – so that we observe them
>
> What does this mean we must observe? – our consciences, the Word

3.  **Sufficiency of Scripture**

> Even though God has not revealed to us *everything* He knows, has He
> revealed enough for salvation?
>
> <u>2 Timothy 3:15</u> – and that from childhood you have known
> **<u>the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that
> leads to salvation</u>** through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
>
> What can Scripture do? – lead us to salvation through faith in Christ
> Jesus
>
> <u>Romans 10:17</u> – **<u>faith comes by hearing</u>** and
> **<u>hearing by the word of God</u>**
>
> What leads to faith? – hearing
>
> Hearing what? – the word of God
>
> <u>Romans 1:16</u> – For I am not ashamed of **<u>the gospel</u>**,
> for it **<u>is the power of God for salvation</u>** to everyone who
> believes
>
> What is the gospel? – the power of God for salvation for those who
> believe the message of the gospel
>
> **READ**: <u>Romans 10:9-10</u> – if you confess with our mouth Jesus
> as Lord, and believe in your hear that God raised Him from the dead,
> you will be saved; for with the heart a person believes, resulting in
> righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in
> salvation.
>
> Christ, the Lord, died on the Cross as an atoning sacrifice for your
> sins and God raised Him from the dead on the third day to indicate His
> satisfaction with Christ’s sacrifice as payment for our sin debt to
> God. If you believe in your heart that Christ’s atoning work can
> provide forgiveness of your sins *and* you submit to Him as Lord over
> *all* your life, you will be saved.
>
> Has Scripture led you into a saving relationship with Jesus Christ?
> Have you submitted your life to the Lordship of Christ?

**<u>Summary</u>** – So, we have general revelation, which is revealed
to man through God’s physical creation, as well as our own consciences.
We also have special revelation, which comes to us through the Word of
God, but which, *when it was given*, occurred through dreams, visions,
miracles, prophets, and Jesus Christ himself.

# Manuscripts of the Bible

> How did we get the Bible?
>
> A. Special Revelation – God spoke through men
>
> <u>2 Peter 1:21</u> – for **<u>no prophecy was ever made by an act of
> human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God</u>**.
>
> **Remember** – prophecy does not necessarily mean foretelling the
> future – it means speaking God’s Word; “moved” – means “carried
> along,” “borne”
>
> Where did the words of the Bible come from? – men inspired by God
> (have them read 2 Timothy 3:16).
>
> Scripture is not of the human will or origin; it is the product of the
> Holy Spirit inspiring the writers to write Scripture. But, the writers
> were not merely secretaries receiving dictation from the Holy Spirit –
> the Holy Spirit used the writers’ personalities, thought processes,
> and vocabulary to produce exactly what God wanted written, and
> Scripture was written without error because the process was
> superintended by the Holy Spirit. Therefore, **<u>the *original*
> manuscripts containing Scripture were inerrant</u>**.

2.  We do not have any of the original manuscripts today.

3.  There are over many manuscripts (both complete and pieces) in
    existence today. These manuscripts are from numerous Jewish and
    non-Jewish sources. 20,000+ for NT alone.

4.  Dead Sea Scrolls

    1.  Found between 1947-1956

    2.  Found in Qumran at the Northwest corner of the Dead Sea
        (**MAP**)

    3.  Scrolls have been dated to a time period of 100 BC – 100 AD

    4.  Fragments of every OT book except Esther were found, including a
        complete copy of Isaiah.

# Languages of the Bible

> What languages was the Bible written in?

## Old Testament

1.  Mostly in Hebrew – not as precise as Greek; remarkable for poetry

2.  Part in Aramaic – Daniel 2-6 and Ezra 4-7

## New Testament

> 1\. Greek – very precise language that could express fine shades of
> meaning

## Septuagint

1.  Greek translation of OT done by 70 Jewish elders

2.  completed prior to Christ’s earthly ministry

# Translations of the Bible

> Too detailed to get into. Here, we use the NASB, which is a very
> accurate translation. Other good versions: KJV, NKJV, ESV, and NIV.
>
> <u>Reference</u>: How to Choose a Bible Version, Robert Thomas

# Compilation of Books Into the Canon (canon = books of the Bible)

# 

## Old Testament

1.  Written between 1500 and 400 BC

2.  Ezra and Nehemiah may have begun to compile a number of the books
    around 400 AD

3.  OT Canon considered complete – 90 AD – Council of Jamnia

## New Testament

1.  Written from ~44-96 AD

2.  First book written – James

3.  Last book written – Revelation

4.  Council of Carthage – 397 AD – the Bible as we know it today

> C. How were the books of the canon decided upon? – we will look at
> that in greater detail after we survey the Bible

7.  **Introduction to the Old and New Covenants (keep in mind as we
    survey the Bible)**

> **HANDOUT (has more detail)**

What is a covenant? – Greek – *diathēkē* – means an agreement; will;
testament

## Old Covenant/Mosaic Covenant

1.  1446 BC

2.  <u>Exodus 19:5-6</u> – 5 Now then, **<u>if you will indeed obey My
    voice and keep My covenant</u>**, then you shall be **<u>My own
    possession</u>** among all the peoples, for all the earth is Mine; 6
    and **<u>you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy
    nation</u>** …

> **Context** – Moses has the Israelites assembled in the wilderness of
> Sinai after their release from slavery in Egypt, and the Lord commands
> Moses to speak these things to the Israelites
>
> What three titles does God promise to Israel if they obey His voice
> and keep His covenant?
>
> \(1\) My own possession; (2) kingdom of priests; (3) holy nation
>
> What blessings do these three titles translate into? –

\(1\) Israel would be God’s special possession, under His care;

> \(2\) Israel would be God’s representatives on earth;
>
> \(3\) Israel would be specially set apart to God for His purposes.
>
> What is the condition of these blessings? – obedience to God.

3.  In a nutshell, under the Mosaic Covenant, a person receives blessing
    if he or she diligently, completely obeys the Law. The result of
    disobedience was curses. This can be seen in Deuteronomy 28.

> But, as indicated in Romans 3:10 and 3:23 – none of us diligently,
> completely obey God’s law. The Law, however, was never God’s appointed
> means of salvation.
>
> Israel lived under the Mosaic Covenant because it was God’s means of
> providing for Israel to be separate from their pagan neighbors so that
> through God’s blessing on their obedience, they would be a light, or a
> witness, to the unbelieving pagan nations around them, and win them
> over to the true God.

## New Covenant

1.  **First introduced in Jeremiah 31 (about 570-600 BC)**

> <u>Jeremiah 31:31-34</u> – 31 Behold, **<u>days are coming</u>**,
> declares the Lord, when I will make a **<u>new covenant</u>** with the
> house of Israel and with the house of Judah, 32 not like the covenant
> which I made with their fathers in the day I took them by the hand to
> bring them out from the land of Egypt, My covenant which they broke,
> although I was a husband to them, declares the Lord. 33 But this is
> the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those
> days, declares the Lord, **<u>I will put My law within them and on
> their heart I will write it</u>**; and I will be their God, and they
> shall be My people. 34 They will not teach again, each man his
> neighbor and each man his brother saying ‘know the Lord,’ for they
> will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them,
> declares the Lord, for **<u>I will forgive their iniquity and their
> sin I will remember no more</u>**.
>
> What does God, through Jeremiah, say He will make with Israel? – a new
> covenant
>
> When will he make a new covenant with Israel? – in the future (days
> are coming)
>
> What are the terms of the New Covenant? – that God will write His law
> within them and on their hearts
>
> What does that mean? – that He will give Israel a heartfelt desire to
> obey Him
>
> What is the benefit of the New Covenant? – God will forgive and forget
> their sins

2.  **The New Covenant is in Christ’s Blood**

> <u>Luke 22:20</u> – And in the same way He took the cup after they had
> eaten, saying, “This cup which is poured out for you is **<u>the new
> covenant in My blood</u>**.”
>
> What is the basis of the New Covenant? – Christ’s blood, His death

3.  **The Old Covenant is obsolete**

> <u>Hebrews 8:13</u> – When He said, “A new covenant,” **<u>He has made
> the first obsolete</u>**. But whatever is becoming obsolete and
> growing old is ready to disappear.
>
> What is the fate of the Mosaic Covenant? – it is obsolete.

4.  **What then is the purpose of the Law?**

> <u>Galatians 3:24-25</u> – 24 Therefore, **<u>the law has become our
> tutor to lead us to Christ</u>**, so that we may be justified by
> faith. 25 But **<u>now that faith has come, we are no longer under a
> tutor</u>**.
>
> Justified? – declared righteous in God’s sight
>
> What was the purpose of the law? – to be a tutor to lead us to Christ
>
> Once we have come to Christ, do we need a tutor? – No (see Romans 7:6)
>
> <u>Romans 7:7</u> – the apostle Paul, a devout Old Covenant Jew for a
> substantial portion of his life said, “**<u>I would not have come to
> know sin except through the Law</u>**.”
>
> **<u>Summary of the New Covenant</u>** – forgiveness in Christ’s
> atoning blood – works are not required to be saved and forgiven of
> sins; The Holy Spirit places a desire in our hearts to obey; renders
> obsolete the Old Covenant

# Introduction to Bible Survey

> Jet tour through the Bible. Not enough time to discuss each book. I
> will present select aspects of the Bible to focus on so that we can
> understand a bit about the structure of the Bible, the history of
> Israel, and the prophecies of Christ, the Messiah, in the OT. For the
> NT, I will give an overview of a number of the books. Hopefully, this
> will be enriching to you, although, it is certainly no substitute for
> reading the Bible itself, which I encourage you to do.
>
> Good Bible Survey references: William Hendriksen’s “Survey of the
> Bible”; D. Edmond Hiebert, “An Introduction to the New Testament”.

# The Basic Structure of the OT – DON’T COVER - look at your lesson at 2<sup>nd</sup> to last page – familiarize yourself with

## 39 books in the OT

## Four Major Sections in OT

1.  Pentateuch/Books of the Law/Five Books of Moses

2.  Historical Books

3.  Poetic Books/Wisdom Literature

4.  Prophetic Books

    1.  Major Prophets (“major” because the books are longer)

    2.  Minor Prophets

<!-- -->

10. **OT Survey (focus on history of Israel and prophecies related to
    Christ in the OT)**

Have them kind look at their Bibles as we go – pretty much a narrative
though

## History of Israel

1.  **Genesis**

> The book of Genesis begins the Bible, and it begins with God “in the
> beginning” in eternity past (1:1). God then spoke the universe into
> creation in six *literal* days, and the seventh day was a day of rest.
> In the process, God created man and woman and instructed them to be
> fruitful and multiply (Ch. 1).
>
> <u>Chs. 2 and 3</u> - Adam and Eve, whom God created, lived in the
> Garden of Eden in fellowship with God, and in obedience to God, until
> the serpent (Satan) tempted Eve to eat what God deemed the forbidden
> fruit. This is referred to as the Fall of Man, when sin nature entered
> into man’s nature.
>
> Genesis 12 is one of the key portions of all Scripture. It contains
> what is referred to as the Abrahamic Covenant. On the heels of
> scattering man and creating nations in Chapter 11, God utters the
> following to a pagan man from what is modern day Iraq or Iran, named
> Abraham:
>
> <u>Genesis 12:1-3</u> – Now the Lord said to Abram, ‘Go forth from
> your country, and from your relatives and from your father’s house, to
> the land which I will show you; and **<u>I will make you a great
> nation</u>**, and I will bless you, and make your name great; and so
> you shall be a blessing; and I will bless those who bless you, and the
> one who curses you, I will curse. **<u>And in you all the families of
> the earth will be blessed</u>**.
>
> What does God command Abram to do? – leave his home and his land and
> go to an unspecified land that God would show him.
>
> What does God promise? – He would make Abraham a great nation, He
> would bless him, and make his name great.
>
> What does God’s promise to make Abraham a great nation mean in light
> of God creating nations just before? – He is establishing a nation
> through which God will bless others. A chosen people.
>
> The rest of Genesis begins to show the process of God's choosing and
> developing a chosen people through Abraham and his descendants.

2.  **Exodus**

> Exodus begins with Abraham’s descendants in slavery in Egypt.
>
> Discusses the birth of Moses, and God’s use of him as an instrument to
> free Israel from slavery in Egypt, and Israel’s subsequent exit from
> Egypt.
>
> On the eve of Israel’s departure, the Passover was instituted.
>
> **<u>What was/is the Passover</u>**? - God had ordained plagues
> against Egypt to cause Egypt to realize that God was incomparable.
> Last plague was that the firstborn in Egypt would be killed. God told
> Moses that the Israelites were to apply an unblemished lamb’s blood to
> their doorposts, and the plague would “pass over” those households.
> The Israelites obeyed, and their firstborn lived. Other aspects of the
> Passover such unleavened (leaven-free) bread and bitter herbs.
>
> Jesus Christ is referred to as the “Lamb of God” (John 1:29, 36), and
> “our Passover” (1 Corinthians 5:7). Christ was also crucified on
> Passover.
>
> The Book of Exodus also documents the deliverance of Israel from
> Egypt, the parting of the Red Sea, the giving of the Ten Commandments,
> and the Israelites’ journey towards the Promised Land.
>
> One last key point that occurred just prior to God giving the Ten
> Commandments is the Old Covenant God made with Israel – that is in
> your handout from last week. You can note it at Exodus 19:1-6.

3.  **Leviticus**

> Defines the worship of Israel and established the Levitical priesthood
> that would oversee the worship of Israel, including the various
> offerings and sacrifices that were part of Israel’s worship.
>
> Delineated various Jewish feasts/holidays.
>
> Anyone know why the priesthood is called “Levitical”? – tribe Levi
>
> **Important Theme** – <u>Leviticus 11:44, 19:2</u> – “You shall be
> **<u>holy</u>**, for I the Lord your God am **<u>holy</u>**.”
>
> What is holiness? – OPEN – Hebrew – *kadosh* – has religious
> connotation meaning “devoted” or “dedicated”; can also mean
> “separated” – those chosen by God are to separate themselves from the
> mainstream and devote or dedicate themselves to living for God
> according to His standards.

4.  **Joshua**

> This book discusses the Israelites’ entry into and conquest of the
> Promised Land and the settlement of the Twelve Tribes of Israel in
> their appointed lands. **MAP**.

5.  **Psalms (out of order here, but wanted to mention)**

The Psalms are Israel’s songbook. They contain wisdom, praise,
confession of sin, warnings, and messianic prophecies. They are very
rich to study and read through.

> Recommend – Spurgeon – Treasury of David for detailed study; Varner –
> Awake O Harp.

6.  **History of Israel - 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Kings, 1
    Chronicles, 2 Chronicles - HANDOUTS**

> These are historical books that span from the time of the end of the
> period of Judges (ca. 1000 BC) to the end of the OT in about 400 BC.
>
> **Samuel** was the last judge in Israel, and the people had come to
> him demanding a king so they could be like the nations around them
> (something contrary to God’s call to Israel to be His holy, separate
> people in the Old Covenant)
>
> Israel wanted a man named **Saul** as their king b/c he was mighty and
> good looking. He turned out to be a flop and had serious emotional
> problems.
>
> The man anointed by Samuel as Saul’s successor was **David**. David is
> a prominent figure in the Bible. He wrote many of the Psalms, and is
> quoted frequently in the NT. He became king of Israel and made Israel
> a mighty and prosperous nation both materially and spiritually.
> Although he was a “man after God’s own heart,” he was not sinless. In
> fact, he was quite the sinner. He committed adultery with Bathsheba,
> and then caused the husband of Bathsheba to be killed in battle. His
> confession is recorded in Psalm 51. He was a lousy father whose
> children rebelled against him and were in all sorts of trouble.
> Nevertheless, his repentant heart never turned away from God, and he
> humbly confessed His sins to God, and God rewarded him with one of the
> great legacies in Scripture.
>
> **<u>DAVIDIC COVENANT</u>** – <u>2 Samuel 7:12-16</u> – READ; 2 Samuel
> 23:5; Psalm 89 – God promised David that the Messiah would come
> through David’s line and would reign on the throne of Israel forever.
>
> David had a son named **Solomon** who became king after David. Early
> in his life, Solomon was a wise and prosperous king. He was given the
> gift of building the original Temple in Jerusalem as a place where God
> could be worshipped. Solomon wrote Proverbs, which is full of wise
> teachings for life. Solomon, however, had numerous wives, including
> some who were not Jews (against God’s law), and his intermingling with
> the surrounding pagan cultures corrupted him.

As a testament to what had happened in his life, Solomon penned the book
Ecclesiastes, which describes a life in pursuit of worldly things such
as money, property, and prestige as futile and vain. He ends the book of
Ecclesiastes by saying:

> <u>Ecclesiastes 12:1, 13-14</u> – 1 **<u>Remember also your Creator in
> the days of your youth</u>**, before the evil days come and the years
> draw near when you will say ‘I have no delight in them.’ … 13 The end
> of the matter; all has been heard. **<u>Fear God and keep His
> commandments, for this is the whole duty of man</u>**. 14 For God will
> bring every deed into judgment, with every secret thing, whether good
> or evil.
>
> Who does Solomon say to remember when we are young? – our Creator

Why does he say that? – because once we pass our youth, evil enters our
lives, and when we are old we will regret not knowing God and realize
that sin brings only misery.

> What does Solomon say is the whole duty of man? – fear God and keep
> His commandments
>
> What does it mean to fear God? – to revere Him, to be in awe of Him,
> to submit to Him, to trust Him.
>
> Why must we fear God and keep His commandments? – because God is going
> to judge all of our deeds.
>
> As a result of Solomon’s (and his descendants') disobedience to God,
> the kingdom of Israel was split into a Northern Kingdom and a Southern
> Kingdom. This is discussed in 1 Kings 11, and really, the remainder of
> 1 Kings and 2 Kings and in Chronicles, as Israel remained divided for
> the next several hundred years. The Northern Kingdom was referred to
> as Israel, and the Southern Kingdom was referred to as Judah, and each
> had their own kings.
>
> The kings of the Northern Kingdom were **<u>all</u>** idolatrous,
> pagan, evil kings, and the people followed them. Idol worship was
> prevalent, and the people in the North were in complete rebellion
> against God. As a result, God began to send prophets, or spokesmen,
> into both the Northern Kingdom to instruct the people to repent and be
> holy, and to warn of God’s impending judgment, including **Elijah**
> and **Elisha** (discussed in <u>1 Kings 17-2 Kings 13:20</u>) and
> **Amos** and **Hosea** (see books bearing their names).
>
> Suffice it to say that the Northern Kingdom never repented and
> returned to God, and it was taken into captivity through the conquest
> of the Assyrians to their north in 722 BC.

The kings in the Southern Kingdom varied – some were good (e.g.,
Hezekiah and Josiah) and some were not (e.g., Amon). What would happen
in the south was similar to that in the period of judges when there were
cycles of obedience and disobedience.

> Throughout this period of kings (ca. 1000-**586 BC**), the Lord sent
> prophets to the Southern Kingdom, as well, to proclaim God’s truth, to
> urge the people to turn back to the Lord, and to warn of impending
> judgment should the people fail to repent. The prophets sent include
> **Joel**, **Micah**, **Isaiah**, **Zephaniah**, **Habakkuk**, and
> **Jeremiah**. Their ministries can be read about in the books bearing
> their names.
>
> **Ezekiel** and **Daniel** also began their ministries around the time
> that the Babylonians overran Jerusalem, destroyed the Temple, and took
> Israel into captivity for their idolatry (605-586BC). 2 Chronicles
> 36:14-16 describes the setting. **READ**.

7.  **Daniel**

> The book of Daniel describes the captivity to some degree,
> particularly how he remained faithful to the Lord during the
> captivity. Daniel’s book also contains a lot of prophecy, some of
> which has already been fulfilled, and some about the end times which
> remains to be fulfilled.

8.  **Ezra and Nehemiah**

> Ezra and Nehemiah describe the returns of the Israelites from
> Babylonian Captivity from about 538 BC through the end of the OT
> period in about 400 BC. The Temple was rebuilt during this time.
>
> During Ezra’s time, the prophets **Haggai** and **Zechariah** carried
> out their ministries, which can be read about in the books named after
> them.
>
> During Nehemiah’s time, **Malachi** was carrying out his prophetic
> ministry. Through Malachi was the final revelation God would give His
> people Israel for over 400 years.

## OT Prophecies Related to Christ 

######### HANDOUT – Prophecies of Christ in OT – have them look up Scriptures

> In fact, although the OT is the story of a nation, Israel, and its
> people, the entire OT really points to Christ, through the sacrificial
> system, God’s gracious preservation of the genetic line of David
> through whom the Messiah would come (He did so even through the
> Babylonian captivity), and prophecies about Christ.

# Intertestamental Period

At the chronological end of the OT, Israel had returned to the Promised
Land from their captivity in Babylon. In Jerusalem, the Temple had been
rebuilt, and the walls around Jerusalem were also rebuilt. These events
take us to approximately 400 BC. After this time, things are quiet on
God’s prophetic and redemptive timetable.

# Basic Structure of NT

## 27 Books in NT

## Basic Divisions of the NT - We are not going to get into this in great detail because we are going to be covering so much of the NT in this class.

1.  **Historical Books – Gospels and Acts -** historical accounts of
    Christ’s life and the early church and the spread of the gospel
    (“good news”)

2.  **Letters/Epistles**

    1.  some are to general audiences; some to specific churches for
        specific issues; some to individuals – they are doctrinal
        letters that expound on the life and teachings of Christ in the
        context of particular situations – heresies and sin to combat
        (Galatians, Corinthians), young ministers to encourage (Timothy)

    2.  written by apostles or other eyewitnesses to the life of Christ

        1.  **Paul** – an apostle (wrote 13 letters)

        2.  **John** – an apostle (they one whom Jesus loved) – besides
            the Gospel of John, he wrote 1 John, 2 John, 3 John, and the
            prophetic book, Revelation

        3.  **Peter** – an apostle – wrote 1 Peter and 2 Peter

        4.  **James** – half brother of Jesus; leader of the church in
            Jerusalem (the first church) – wrote James

        5.  **Jude** – half brother of Jesus, brother of James wrote a
            letter warning false teachers

        6.  **Hebrews** – author is unknown

3.  **Prophetic – Revelation** – written by the apostle John in
    approximately 95 AD (he was likely the last surviving apostle)

# NT Survey

## Matthew

1.  Written by Matthew to a Jewish audience – a Jewish tax collector

2.  **Presents Christ as Messiah and King**

> <u>Matthew 21:5</u> – Say to the daughter of Zion, ‘**<u>Behold your
> King</u>** is coming to you, gentle, and mounted on a donkey, even on
> a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.

1.  **Genealogy of Christ** – <u>Matthew 1:1-17</u> – Abraham to Christ

> Establishes Christ’s claim to the throne by showing his *legal descent
> from David* through Joseph
>
> <u>Luke 3:23-38</u> - Luke presents Christ’s genealogy from Adam to
> Christ and shows Christ’s *blood right to the throne through David*

3.  **Virgin Birth a Requirement**

    1.  Prophesied by Isaiah in Isaiah 7:14

    2.  **Reason** – Jeconiah was an evil king in the lineage of Christ,
        through Joseph. Jeremiah 22:30 says no descendant of Jeconiah
        would ever take the throne of David. If Christ was in the
        *blood* line of Joseph, He could not assume the throne. But,
        Christ was <u>not</u> in the blood line of Joseph, but of the
        Holy Spirit. Christ carried the *royal* blood through Mary, who
        was also in the line of David, but not through Jeconiah.

4.  Key Moral Teaching – Sermon on the Mount – Chs. 5-7

5.  Key End Times Teaching – Olivet Discourse – Chs. 24-25

## Mark

1.  Written by Mark to a Roman audience (Peter’s account)

2.  **Presents Christ as Servant**

    1.  <u>Mark 10:43-45</u> – But it is not this way among you, but
        **<u>whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your
        servant</u>**; 44 and whoever wishes to be first among you shall
        be slave of all. 45 For even **<u>the Son of Man did not come to
        be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for
        many</u>**.

> How does Christ say one becomes great or first? – serve others
>
> What does Christ say about Himself? – He came to serve and give His
> life as a ransom for many
>
> What is a ransom? – a payment to free from captivity
>
> To free from what? – bondage to sin and death

## Luke

1.  Written by Luke – a gentile physician

2.  Written based on a careful investigation through many eyewitnesses
    so that the exact truth about Christ could be known, including many
    details about His ancestry, birth, and development

3.  Presents Christ as the Son of Man (emphasizing Christ’s humanity)

## John

1.  Written by John – a fisherman, apostle

2.  **Presents Christ as God**

3.  Key Verses – many –

    1.  <u>John 20:31</u> – purpose of book – “these have been written
        so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of
        God; and that believing you may have life in His name”

    2.  here is a familiar one – <u>John 3:16</u> – For God so loved the
        world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes
        in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.

Who so loved the world? – God

> How did God show He so loved the world? – He gave His only begotten
> Son
>
> Who is God’s Son - Christ
>
> What is required for eternal life? – belief in Christ
>
> Do you know if you have eternal life? Do you believe in Christ?
>
> What does it mean to believe in Christ? – submit, trust, abide, obey

**  **

**Lesson One – Part 3**

**Opening Prayer**

We are in our NT Survey. Remember, the basic divisions of the NT are:
(1) Historical books – Gospels and Acts; (2) Letters/Epistles; (3)
Prophetic (Revelation).

## Acts

1.  Ascension of Christ after Resurrection and post-resurrection
    appearances

2.  Birth of the Church – Pentecost; History of early church

3.  Main characters

    1.  Peter and John

    2.  Paul – missionary journeys - **MAP**

> Paul was a highly trained Jewish rabbi who earlier in his life
> vigorously persecuted the early church. Paul was converted in Acts 9
> on the Damascus Road while he was on the way to arrest Christians. He
> went on four missionary journeys, established numerous churches, and
> was a prolific writer in the NT. His letters contain much doctrine
> regarding personal holiness and church life.

4.  Documents expansion of the Gospel from Jerusalem to Samaria to Syria
    to Turkey to Greece to Italy.

## Paul’s Letters

> Paul’s letters addressed doctrinal issues in some of the *churches* he
> founded (1 and 2 Cor., Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians,
> 1 and 2 Thess.), to provide doctrine and exhortation to other churches
> (Romans), or to *individuals* to guide and disciple them in their
> ministries (1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon)

1.  **Paul’s Life**

> <u>2 Timothy 4:7</u> – (uttered near the end of his life) – I have
> fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the
> faith.
>
> How does that apply to you in your own life? - OPEN

## General Letters

> We will look at these briefly in the order they appear in the NT after
> the Gospels, Acts, and Paul’s letters.

1.  **Hebrews**

> Author unknown. Written primarily to Jews, some who believed, some who
> were close to believing, and some who did not believe.
>
> The primary topic of Hebrews is the superiority of Christ – the
> superiority of Christ to Moses, to the Levitical Priesthood, and the
> superiority of His sacrifice compared to the sacrificial system in the
> OT, especially in the book of Leviticus. It also contains the famous
> Ch. 11 – Hall of Faith.

2.  **James**

> Written by James – half brother of Jesus
>
> Contains a series of tests for determining whether one has genuine
> saving faith. It is a very practical book. It challenges us to examine
> our faith.
>
> Key verse: <u>James 2:17</u> – Even so, faith, if it has no works, is
> dead.
>
> What does this mean? What are works?
>
> Is your faith in Christ being demonstrated by your works?

3.  **1 Peter**

> Written by Peter, an apostle of Christ, to encourage those early
> Christians to stand firm in the faith despite the persecution they
> were facing.

4.  **2 Peter**

> Written by Peter, an apostle of Christ as a warning against false
> teachers.

5.  **1 -3 John**

> Written by apostle John (same as gospel of John and Revelation). 1
> John 5:13 says the letter was written to believers so that they may
> know they have eternal life.
>
> This book is about Christians’ relationships with each other and with
> God. The book portrays God as a God of love, light, and life.
>
> 2 John is a letter to a woman from John, exhorting the woman to live
> in obedience to Christ’s commandments, and to beware of false
> teachers.
>
> 3 John is a letter to a man named Gaius, whom John loved. It commends
> of Gaius’ treatment of traveling teachers, and an exhortation to him
> not to show hospitality or fellowship with false teachers.

6.  **Jude**

> Jude is another half brother of Christ. He was not an apostle, but he
> obviously was an eyewitness of Christ’s life.
>
> This book is another scathing condemnation of false teachers. Its
> exhortation is to “contend earnestly for **the faith**” (v. 3) and
> seek to snatch those subject to false teachers “out of the fire”
> (v.23).

7.  **Revelation**

> Written by John while he was exiled on the small Greek island of
> Patmos. He was exiled by the Romans for his teachings about Christ.
> God gave John a vision of the future – the end times. This book
> culminates God’s special revelation and relates back to many things in
> Genesis.
>
> I recommend Pastor MacArthur’s book “Because the Time is Near.”

# The Inspiration of the Bible

> What does “inspiration” of the Bible mean? - OPEN
>
> **<u>Inspiration</u>** – involves God overseeing and directing men to
> write His words. God initiates the process and works through men,
> without compromising their individual personalities and vocabularies,
> to produce divinely inspired writings.
>
> *Theopneustos* (Gr.) – literally means “God-breathed.” *Theos* – God;
> *pneo* – to breathe – used in 2 Timothy 3:16 to indicate that all
> Scripture is God-breathed.
>
> \*\*So, *revelation* is God revealing Himself to us; *inspiration* is
> how He did it!\*\*
>
> Do you believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of God?

## Divine Sovereignty

1.  **God is in total control of all things (including His Word)**

> <u>Isaiah 46:10</u> (God speaking through the prophet Isaiah) –
> Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things
> which have not been done, saying, ‘**<u>My purpose will be
> established, and I will accomplish all My good pleasure</u>**.”
>
> Whose purpose will be established? – God’s
>
> What will God accomplish – **<u>all</u>** His good pleasure
>
> Who is in control of all things? – God

2.  **God will preserve His Word**

> <u>Isaiah 40:8</u> – The grass withers, the flower fades, but **<u>the
> word of our God stands forever</u>**.
>
> What does Isaiah say “stands forever”? – the Word of God
>
> As opposed to what? – the grass and flowers, which wither and fade

3.  **God is protective of His Word**

> <u>Deuteronomy 4:2</u> – **<u>You shall not add to the word which I am
> commanding you, nor take away from it</u>**, that you may keep the
> commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.

What does Moses warn the Israelites about? – adding to or taking away
from the Word.

> <u>Revelation 22:18-19</u> – 18 I testify to everyone who hears the
> words of the prophecy of this book; **<u>if anyone adds to them, God
> will add to him the plagues which are written in this book</u>**; 19
> and **<u>if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this
> prophecy, God will take away his part from the tree of life and from
> the holy city, which are written in this book</u>**.
>
> What will happen if one adds to or takes away from the Word of God? -
> consequences; punishment; indicative of no salvation.
>
> What is the significance of the last few verses in the last book of
> the Bible containing such warnings? – serious warning against
> tampering with the Word of God; in fact, God has preserved His Word in
> numerous internally consistent manuscripts for 2000 years. This
> indicates that God wanted His truths accurately preserved so that His
> truths would last forever.
>
> Practically speaking, what should we do if we encounter someone who
> claims to “have the Word of God”? – test what He says against the
> Bible to make sure that it is consistent with the Bible. If not, such
> a claim should be rejected.
>
> **So, we can see God’s sovereignty over all things, including the
> preservation and protection of His Word.**

## The Holy Spirit Witnesses to the Inspiration of Scripture

1.  **The Holy Spirit, through the Word, leads men to salvation and a
    transformed life**

> <u>Romans 10:17</u> – **<u>faith comes by hearing</u>** and
> **<u>hearing by the word of Christ</u>**
>
> What leads to faith? – hearing
>
> Hearing what? – the word of Christ; the word about Christ

2.  **The Holy Spirit, through the Word, convicts and judges our
    thoughts and hearts**

> <u>Hebrews 4:12</u> – For **<u>the word of God is living and active
> and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the
> division of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and able to
> judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart</u>**.

What is living and active? – the Word of God

> What does it mean to pierce to the division of soul and spirit and
> joints and marrow? – the truths of the Word of God can penetrate us at
> the deepest possible level
>
> What does the Word of God judge? – thoughts and intentions of our
> heart?
>
> What does that mean? – the Word is the standard by which our hearts
> and minds are judged; the Word convicts us of sin.
>
> Is your life, including your thoughts, intentions, and motivations,
> submitted to the Word of God? OR, are you ignoring what you know to be
> the teachings of Scripture??

3.  **The Holy Spirit enables us to know the things of God**

> <u>1 Corinthians 2:11-12</u> – 11 For who among men knows the thoughts
> of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so
> **<u>the thoughts of God no one knows except the Spirit of God</u>**.
> 12 Now **<u>we have received</u>**, not the spirit of the world, but
> **<u>the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely
> given to us by God</u>**.
>
> Who is the only One who knows the thoughts of God? – the Holy Spirit

What does the Holy Spirit do in those who have received Him by
salvation? – enables us to know the things of God

> **So, the Holy Spirit testifies to the inspiration of Scripture by
> leading men to salvation through the Word, convicting us of sin
> through the Word, and enabling us to know the Word.**

#### C. The Bible Claims to be the Word of God

1.  **All Scripture is God-breathed**

<u>2 Timothy 3:16</u> – \[a\]ll Scripture is inspired by God.

How much Scripture is inspired by God? – all of it

<u>2 Peter 1:20-21</u> – 20 know this first of all, that **<u>no
prophecy of Scripture is a matter one’s own interpretation</u>**, 21
**<u>for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will</u>**,
**<u>but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God</u>**.

How much Scripture was made by an act of human will? - none of it.

How was Scripture made? - men moved by the Holy Spirit

Can Scripture mean whatever we want it to mean? - No.

Scripture is not a matter of what? - one's own interpretation.

We will see this more in Lesson 2, but Scripture is not subject to
personal interpretation/meaning -- Scripture means what God intended it
to mean through the original authors, to the original audiences. One
meaning – many applications (in some cases).

> **2. The Bible Claims to be The Word of God**
>
> The Bible itself indicates that it is God’s Word over 2,000 times with
> phrases such as “**<u>God said …</u>**” (Genesis 1:3, 6:3; Exodus
> 16:4; Acts 9:15; Acts 18:9) and “**<u>The word of the Lord …</u>**”
> (Acts 8:25, 11:16, 12:24, 13:48; 1 Thessalonians 4:15; 1 Peter 1:25).

3.  **Jesus Christ Confirmed that the OT was God’s Word**

<!-- -->

1.  **Jesus’ Temptation by Satan**

> <u>Matthew 4:1-11</u> – Jesus Christ quoted from the OT to resist
> Satan’s temptations (Deuteronomy 8:3, 6:16, 6:13) – said “it is
> written”

### 4. NT Writers Believed That They Were Writing God’s Word

> There are also many other statements in the NT that affirm the fact
> that the writers of the NT believed that they were writing the very
> words of God.
>
> <u>1 Corinthians 14:37</u> – \[i\]f anyone thinks he is a prophet or
> spiritual, let Him recognize that **<u>the things which I write to you
> are the Lord’s commandment</u>**
>
> How did Paul refer to the things that he wrote to the Corinthians? –
> as a commandment from the Lord
>
> <u>See also</u>: 2 Corinthians 12:17; Galatians 1:11-12; 1
> Thessalonians 2:13, 4:15
>
> **So, in a number of instances, Paul believed his message to be the
> Word of God.**

### 5. Other Instances of Inspiration – <u>just state verses</u>

<u>1 Timothy 5:18</u> – Paul refers to Luke 10:7 as “Scripture”

<u>2 Pet. 3:15-16</u> – Peter regards Paul’s letters as Scripture

<u>John 12:50</u> – Jesus indicates that He spoke the word of God

**So, the Bible claims to be the Word of God by: (1) explicitly making
that claim (2 Timothy 3:16; “The Lord says…”); (2) Christ confirming the
OT; (3) numerous parallel passages between the OT and NT in which God
speaks; (4) NT writers believing that they were writing God’s Word**

**<u>Summary</u>**: we believe that the Bible is the inspired Word of
God because: (1) God’s sovereignty; (2) the Holy Spirit’s witness; (3)
the explicit claims of the Bible; and, (4) the New Testament writers
affirming that the OT and what they wrote was God’s Word

# Believability of the Bible

What evidences are there that the Bible is true, accurate, and
ultimately, believeable?

## Historical Accuracy

> Archaeology has confirmed a number of biblical details – For
> interesting reading on this topic –
> <http://www.christiananswers.net/archaeology/home.html>

####### The Flood - The fossil record confirms that there was a worldwide flood about 4,500-5,000 years ago.

## Internally Consistent – 40 writers/66 books written in 3 languages over 1600 years; BUT, no errors or contradictions!!!

## Scriptures Confirmed by Christ

1.  **Confirms Jews' Rejection of Christ, as Predicted** – Psalm 118:22

> <u>Mark 12:10</u> – Have you not even read **<u>this Scripture</u>**:
> ‘the stone which the builders rejected, This became the chief corner
> stone.’

2.  **Confirms Burning Bush Event** – Exodus 3:6

> <u>Mark 12:26</u> – “But regarding the fact that the dead rise again,
> **<u>have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the
> burning bush</u>**, how God spoke to him saying, ‘I am the God of
> Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?’”
>
> Other: <u>Matthew 10:15</u> – Sodom and Gomorrah; <u>Matthew 12:40</u>
> – Jonah in the belly of the whale; <u>John 6:49</u> – manna to the
> Jews during the Exodus
>
> **In each of these instances, Christ refers back to the OT and
> indicated He believed them, confirmed them, and rebuked people for not
> reading/knowing the Scriptures.**

## Scripture is Life-Changing

> The Bible has dramatically changed millions of lives for thousands of
> years.
>
> <u>Example in Scripture</u> - <u>Acts 16:14</u> – A woman named Lydia,
> from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple fabrics, a worshiper of
> God, was listening \[to what Paul was teaching\]; and the Lord opened
> her heart to respond to **<u>the things spoken by Paul</u>**.

## Prophetic Accuracy (most powerful) – <u>ASK FOR EXAMPLES</u>

1.  **Birthplace of the Messiah – prophesied in Micah 5:2 (700 years
    before Christ); fulfilled in Luke 2:4-7**

2.  **Virgin Birth of the Messiah – prophesied in Isaiah 7:14 (700 years
    before Christ); fulfilled in Matthew 1:18-25**

3.  **Triumphal Entry – prophesied in Zech 9:9 (500 years before
    Christ); fulfilled in John 12:12-15**

4.  **Christ’s Crucifixion – prophesied in Psalm 22 (1000 years before
    Christ); fulfilled in John 19**

5.  **Christ’s Suffering**

> **Prophecy (700 years before Christ)**: <u>Isaiah 53:4-7</u> – 4
> Surely our griefs He Himself bore, And our sorrows He carried; Yet we
> ourselves esteemed Him stricken, Smitten of God, and afflicted. 5 But
> **<u>He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was crushed for
> our iniquities</u>**; The chastening for our well-being fell upon Him,
> And **<u>by His scourging we are healed</u>**. 6 All of us like sheep
> have gone astray, Each of us has turned to his own way; But the LORD
> has caused the iniquity of us all To fall on Him. 7 He was oppressed
> and He was afflicted, **<u>Yet He did not open His mouth; Like a lamb
> that is led to slaughter, And like a sheep that is silent before its
> shearers, So He did not open His mouth</u>**.
>
> **Fulfillment**:
>
> <u>Matthew 26:63</u> – (fulfills Isaiah 53:7) - But **<u>Jesus kept
> silent</u>**. And the high priest said to Him, ‘I adjure You by the
> living God, that You tell us whether You are the Christ, the Son of
> God.’
>
> How did Jesus respond to those who accused Him? – silence
>
> <u>2 Corinthians 5:21</u> – **<u>He made Him who knew no sin to be sin
> on our behalf</u>**, so that we might become the righteousness of God
> in Him
>
> What did God make Jesus? – sin; a sin offering on our behalf
>
> What portions of Isaiah 53 does this relate to? – pierced, crushed,
> caused iniquity of us all to fall on Him
>
> <u>1 Peter 2:24</u> – and **<u>He Himself bore our sins in His body on
> the cross</u>**, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness;
> **<u>for by wounds you were healed</u>**.
>
> What did Jesus bear in His body on the Cross? – our sins
>
> What do we gain by His wounds? – we are healed
>
> Does this sound like physical healing? – No (context)
>
> What kind of healing does this sound like? – spiritual healing
>
> What does this tell us about Jesus’ work on the Cross? – atoned for
> our sins, healed us spiritually, restored us to well-being
>
> Have you embraced for yourself Jesus’ work on the Cross?

## Summary

> So, we can believe what the Bible says because:

1.  It is historically accurate

2.  It is internally consistent

3.  It was confirmed by Christ

4.  It is life-changing, and has proven to be over time

5.  It contains numerous fulfillments of prophecy

# The Canon

We’ve covered this a bit, and we need to move through it quickly. How
were the books in the Canon of Scripture decided upon? – Councils – but,
let’s look at God’s hand on the process.

## God’s Sovereignty

> <u>Isaiah 46:10</u> – Declaring the end from the beginning, and from
> ancient times things which have not been done, saying, ‘**<u>My
> purpose will be established, and I will accomplish all My good
> pleasure</u>**.” (we looked at this earlier)
>
> <u>Ephesians 1:11</u> – \[God\] works **<u>all things</u>** after the
> counsel of His will
>
> How many things does God work out after the counsel of His will? –
> **<u>all</u>** things, *including the writing, collecting, and
> preserving of His Word*

## God’s Faithfulness

> Besides God’s sovereignty, we must consider His faithfulness. We could
> ask the question, what should we believe if someone claims to have
> found another “inspired” writing? Our response should be: why would
> God hold back any “inspired” writings that are meant to direct mankind
> to salvation through Jesus Christ? That just would not make sense.

# Application

## Do you believe that what the Bible says is true?

Do you believe that the 66 books of the Bibles are God’s Word?
