Lesson 3 – Additional Notes

Question – Is it correct to say that the resurrection was an indication
of God’s approval of Jesus’ death on the cross as making atonement for
the sins of all believers for all time?

Answer – Yes.

<u>Mayhue/MacArthur, Biblical Doctrine, 320</u> – “Christ’s resurrection
achieved the following vast and glorious results: … 6. **Proof that the
Father accepted the atoning work of Christ in his sacrificial death on
the cross (Rom. 4:25)**”

<u>Grudem, Systematic Theology, 615</u> – “Paul says that Jesus ‘was put
to death for our trespasses and raised for our justification’ (Rom.
4:25). **When Christ was raised from the dead, it was God’s declaration
of approval of Christ’s work of redemption**. Because Christ ‘humbled
himself and became obedient unto death, even death on a cross’ (Phil.
2:8), ‘God has highly exalted him … ‘ (Phil. 2:9). By raising Christ
from the deal, God the Father was in effect saying that he approved of
Christ’s work of suffering and dying for our sins, that his work was
completed, and that Christ no longer had any need to remain dead. There
was no penalty left to pay for sin, no more wrath of God to bear, no
more guilt or liability to punishment – all had been completely paid
for, and no guilt remained. **In the resurrection, God was saying to
Christ, ‘I approve of what you have done, and you find favor in my
sight.**’

(cont.) This explains how Paul can say that Christ was ‘raised for our
justification’ (Rom. 4:25). If God ‘raised us up with him’ (Eph. 2:6),
then, by virtue of our union with Christ, God’s declaration of approval
of Christ is also his declaration of approval of us. When the Father in
essence said to Christ, ‘All the penalty for sins has been paid and I
find you not guilty but righteous in my sight,’ he was thereby making
the declaration that would also apply to us once we trusted in Christ
for our salvation. In this way, Christ’s resurrection also gave final
proof that he had earned our justification.”

<u>Schreiner, Romans, 244 (re: Romans 4:23-25)</u> – “To day that Jesus
was raised because of our justification is to say that **his
resurrection authenticates and confirms that our justification has been
secured**. The resurrection of Christ constitutes evidence that his work
on our behalf has been completed.”

<u>Hendriksen, Romans, 161 (re: Romans 4:23-25)</u> – “‘He was delivered
up *for*, or *on account of*, our trespasses’ *looks backward* and means
that our trespasses made it necessary for him to be delivered up, while
‘(he) was raised *for*, or *on account of*, our justification’ *looks
forward* and indicates that he was raised in order to assure us that in
the sight of God we are indeed without sin. In other words, Christ’s
resurrection has as its *purpose* to bring to light the fact that all
those who acknowledge Jesus as their Lord and Savior have entered into a
state of righteousness in the eyes of God. **The Father, by raising
Jesus from the dead, assures us that the atoning sacrifice has been
accepted; hence**, our sins are forgiven.”

<u>Sproul, Romans: The Righteous Shall Live by Faith, 135 (re: Romans
4:23-25)</u> – “Christ laid down his life for his sheep on the cross. He
offered himself in his perfect righteousness and took upon himself the
sin of his people. If Jesus had stayed dead, we would have no
justification, but when the Father raised the Son from the dead, he said
to the world, ‘I accept this payment for the debtors who cannot pay.’
**The resurrection of Jesus Christ is not simply for his vindication; it
is for our justification, because it is God’s demonstration to his
unjust people that he accepts the payment in full for the moral debt
they have incurred.**”
