#### The Person of God

## God’s existence

1.  God’s existence is never questioned – it is assumed

> <u>Genesis 1:1</u> – **<u>In the beginning God</u>** created the
> heavens and the earth.
>
> From when did God exist? – from the beginning
>
> Was there anything before Him? – no
>
> Was He created? - no
>
> When did creation take place in relation to God’s existence? – after
>
> What does that say about God’s existence? – He has always existed

2.  God has existed from eternity

> <u>Isaiah 43:13</u> – **<u>Even from eternity I am He</u>**, and there
> is none who can deliver out of My hand; I act and who can reverse it?

Who is speaking here? – God (43:1, 11)

How long has He existed? – from eternity

3.  God’s existence is seen in creation

> <u>Romans 1:20</u> – **<u>For since the creation of the world His
> invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been
> clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so that
> they are without excuse</u>**.
>
> Who does creation reveal? – God
>
> What does creation reveal about God? – His invisible attributes, His
> eternal power, and His divine nature
>
> Is God’s existence as seen through creation something mysterious and
> hazy? – No, it is clearly seen and understood
>
> What do we say to those who refuse to acknowledge the existence of God
> based on what has been created? – they are without excuse
>
> As we have previously discussed, does creation give us enough
> revelation to lead to salvation? – No. We need special revelation.
>
> And where do we find special revelation? – The Bible

## God as the only God

1.  God is the only God

<u>Isaiah 44:6-8</u> – Thus says the Lord, the King of Israel and his
Redeemer, the Lord of hosts: ‘**<u>I am the first and the last, and
there is no God besides Me</u>**. 7 **<u>Who is like me?</u>** Let him
proclaim and declare it; Yes, let him recount it to Me in order, from
the time that I established the ancient nation. And let them declare to
them the things that are coming and the events that are going to take
place. 8 Do not tremble and do not be afraid; have I not long since
announced it to you and declared it? And you are my witnesses. **<u>Is
there any God besides Me, or is there any other rock? I know of
none.</u>**’

> Who is speaking here? – God
>
> How does God refer to Himself? – Lord, King of Israel, Israel’s
> redeemer, Lord of hosts.
>
> What does He say about His temporal existence? – He is the first and
> the last
>
> When God says “there is no God besides Me” and “Who is like me?”, what
> word would you use to summarize God’s description of Himself? –
> **<u>incomparable</u>**.
>
> Do you see how God challenges those who may claim to be gods in verse
> 7?
>
> What are some of the marks of God being God? – establishing the
> nations, declaring the things that are coming and the events that are
> going to take place, declaring such things from long ago.
>
> Does God believe that there are any gods besides Him? – No.
>
> What does that mean we should believe? – the God of Scripture is the
> only God?
>
> What kinds of gods do you have in your life? – money, work, a
> relationship?
>
> It is essential that we believe that the God of Scripture is the only
> God, and that we rid our lives of anything else that competes with God
> for our affections.
>
> First two commandments in Ten Commandments

2.  God is plural

> <u>Genesis 1:26a</u> – **<u>Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our
> image, according to Our likeness</u>**; and let them rule over the
> fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over the cattle and
> over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the
> earth.”
>
> Who is speaking? – God\`
>
> What pronoun does He use? – first person plural (“Us”) and first
> person plural possessive (“Our”)
>
> Does this mean that there is more than one God? – No.
>
> What word is used to identify the speaker? – God
>
> Is it plural? – No
>
> Who was God referring to when He said “Us” and “Our” – the Father, the
> Son, and the Holy Spirit
>
> Are the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit each individual gods? – No
>
> What are they then? – three facets of one God – The Trinity
>
> Also – Gen. 3:22; 11:7; Isaiah 6:8.

3.  The Trinity

> Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
>
> Each are God
>
> Each is a different person
>
> Each forms part of one God-head
>
> “Definition” (if the Trinity can even be defined) – “God is absolutely
> and eternally one essence subsisting in three distinct and ordered
> persons without division and without replication of the essence.”
> (Biblical Doctrine, 189).
>
> We will look at this more in Lessons 4 and 7

## Where God is

1.  The Father is in Heaven

> <u>Matthew 6:9</u> – Pray then, in this way: **<u>Our Father who is in
> heaven</u>**, hallowed by Your name.
>
> Where is the Father? – in heaven

2.  Christ is in heaven at the Father’s right hand

> <u>Luke 24:51 (the ascension)</u> – While He was blessing them,
> **<u>He parted from them and was carried up into heaven</u>**.

Where is Christ? – in heaven

<u>Hebrews 10:12</u> – but **<u>He</u>**, having offered one sacrifice
for sins for all time, **<u>sat down at the right hand of God</u>**

Where in heaven is Christ? – at the Father’s right hand

What does it mean to be at the Father’s right hand? – OPEN (pos. of
prominence)

3.  The Holy Spirit is in us

> <u>1 Corinthians 3:16</u> – Do you not know that you are a temple of
> God and that **<u>the Spirit of God dwells in you</u>**?
>
> To whom is Paul writing in 1 Corinthians (1:2)? the believers in
> church in Corinth
>
> In 3:16, who does “you” refer to? – believers in Corinth
>
> Where is the Holy Spirit? – dwelling in believers

## The depth of God

1.  God is incomprehensible

> <u>Romans 11:33-34</u> – **<u>Oh, the depth of the riches both of the
> wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments and
> unfathomable His ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who
> became His counselor?</u>**

How many exclamation points are there in these verses? – two

What does that signify about the writer, Paul? – he was excited, joyous

Who was he excited about? – God

What does Paul say is deep and rich? – the wisdom and knowledge of God

What does Paul say about God’s judgments? – they are unsearchable

What does Paul say about God’s ways? – they are unfathomable

> What do “unsearchable” and “unfathomable” mean? – incomprehensible,
> inscrutable
>
> What does the question in v. 34 signify? – that God’s thoughts are
> beyond our grasp; that God is self-sufficient in His decisionmaking
>
> Read Isaiah 55:8-9

5.  **Knowing God**

    1.  God can only be divinely perceived

> <u>1 Corinthians 2:9-10</u> – but just as it is written, “Things which
> eye has not seen and ear has not heard, and which have not entered the
> heart of man, all that God has prepared for those who love Him.” 10
> **<u>For to us God revealed them through the Spirit; for the Spirit
> searches all things, even the depths of God</u>**.

What things have not been perceived and have not entered the heart of
man? – all that God has prepared for those who love Him

For those who do love God, ***how*** has God revealed such things to us?
– through the Spirit

Because the Spirit dwells in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?

What does that tell us regarding those who do <u>not</u> receive such
things? – they do not have the Spirit

So, the things of God are revealed to believers by the Holy Spirit.
Unbelievers cannot perceive the things of God.

2.  Practical

    1.  Desire to seek God

> <u>Psalm 27:8</u> – When You said ‘seek My face,’ **<u>my heart said
> to You, ‘Your face, O Lord, I shall seek</u>**.’
>
> What does the Psalmist tell us about how to know God? – earnestly seek
> His face.
>
> What do you think the reference to His face means? What does it mean
> if we know what someone looks like? – that we know them personally.
>
> We should strive to know the Lord personally.
>
> Sin separates us from God and blocks our fellowship with Him.
>
> A believer in sin has his or her fellowship with God temporarily
> blocked until repentance is sought.
>
> An unbeliever has no fellowship with God until conversion takes place.
>
> What is the state of your fellowship with God?

2.  Keep His commandments

> <u>John 14:21</u> – **<u>He who has My commandments and keeps them is
> the one who loves Me; and He who loves Me will be loved by my Father,
> and I will love him and disclose Myself to him</u>**.
>
> How do we show our love for the Father and Son? – keep their
> commandments
>
> What does Christ say He will do if we obey Him? – disclose Himself to
> us

So, we have seen: (1) that God’s existence is assumed, He was not
created but has existed from eternity past; (2) that God is the only
God, that God is three persons in one God-head; (3) that the Father is
in heaven, Christ is at His right hand, and the Holy Spirit indwells
believers; (4) that God is incomprehensible, can only be divinely
perceived; but, that we can know Him if we seek Him and keep His
commandments.

#### The Attributes of God

> We have already mentioned that an attribute is a quality, trait, or
> characteristic
>
> Consider this – understanding God’s attributes allows us to offer up
> truer worship to God
>
> Knowing God’s attributes allows us to praise Him for who He truly is
>
> Knowing God’s power allows us to reverently fear Him
>
> Knowing God’s righteousness and holiness humbles us and exposes our
> sinfulness
>
> Knowing God’s mercy allows us to praise Him for His great mercy
>
> Consider this – God’s attributes work in harmony/together
>
> God’s love and justice – at the Cross.
>
> God’s sovereignty and grace – in salvation.

1.  **Sovereignty  **

> What is sovereignty? – ultimate authority, control
>
> <u>Isaiah 46:9-10</u> – Remember the former things long past, For
> **<u>I am God</u>**, and there is no other; I am God, and there is no
> one like me. Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient
> times things which have not been done, saying, “**<u>My purpose will
> be established, and I will accomplish all My good pleasure</u>**.’
>
> Who is speaking? – God
>
> In verse 10, what does He say about His purpose? – it will be
> established
>
> What does He say He will accomplish? – all His good pleasure
>
> Are there any qualifiers given? – No. God will establish His purpose
> and accomplish all His good pleasure.
>
> What is God’s “purpose”? – Redeem a people to Himself through Jesus
> Christ
>
> <u>Isaiah 43:13</u> – Even from eternity I am He, and **<u>there is
> none who can deliver out of My hand; I act and who can reverse
> it</u>**?
>

>
> Who can reverse God’s actions? – no one.
>
> Who is supreme relative to God – no one. God is supreme/sovereign.

## Eternality

> is eternal
>
> <u>Revelation 1:8</u> – **<u>I am the Alpha and the Omega</u>**, says
> the Lord God, **<u>who is and was and who is to come</u>**, the
> Almighty.
>
> Alpha is the first letter of the Greek alphabet and Omega is the last
> letter of the Greek alphabet.
>
> What does God’s reference to Himself as the Alpha and the Omega mean?
> – He is the first and last (eternal) – who is and was and is to come

## Power/Omnipotence

> What does omnipotence mean? – all powerful
>
> <u>Jeremiah 32:17</u> – Ah Lord God! Behold, **<u>You have made the
> heaven and the earth by Your great and by Your outstretched arm</u>**!
> **<u>Nothing is too difficult for You</u>**
>
> Who made the heaven and earth? – God
>
> How much power do you think it took to create everything from Mt.
> Everest to the Pacific Ocean to the minute atoms and chemical
> elements? – more than we can imagine
>
> What do you think “nothing is too difficult for You” means? – God has
> sufficient power to accomplish anything. Nothing is impossible for
> God.
>
> <u>Psalm 62:11</u> – Once God has spoken; twice I have heard this:
> That **<u>power belongs to God</u>**
>
> Who does power belong to? – God
>
> Does it belong to us? - no
>
> <u>Hebrews 1:3</u> – And He \[Christ\] is the radiance of His glory
> and the exact representation of His nature, and **<u>upholds all
> things by the word of His power</u>**. When He had made purification
> of sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high
>
> Who does “He” refer to? – Christ (v.2)
>
> What does Christ uphold? – all things
>
> How does Christ uphold them? – by the word of His power
>
> If Christ upholds all things by His power, what does that mean? – He
> has all power
>
> And who does power belong to? – God
>
> Then, who is Jesus Christ? – God

## Omniscience

> What does omniscience mean? – all-knowing
>
> <u>Job 34:21</u> – For His eyes are upon the ways of a man, and
> **<u>He sees all his steps</u>**.
>
> Who is “His” referring to? – God (v. 10, 12)
>
> Where are God’s eyes? – on our ways
>
> How much of our ways does God see? – all of them
>
> <u>Psalm 147:5</u> – Great is our Lord and abundant in strength;
> **<u>His understanding is infinite</u>**.
>
> What is the extent of God’s understanding? – it is infinite; He knows
> everything
>
> <u>Psalm 139:1-4</u> – **READ** – O Lord, You have searched me and
> known me. You know when I sit down and when I rise up; You understand
> my thought from afar. You scrutinize my path and my lying down, and
> are intimately acquainted with all my ways. Even before there is a
> word on my tongue, Behold, O Lord, You know it all.
>
> So, God knows everything we think, say, and do.
>
> What is your response to that?

## Omnipresence

>
> <u>Proverbs 15:3</u> – **<u>The eyes of the Lord are in every
> place</u>**, watching the evil and the good
>
> Where are the Lord’s eyes? – everywhere (that fits in with His
> omniscience)

<u>Jeremiah 23:23-24</u> – “Am I a God who is near, declares the Lord,
and not a God far off? **<u>Can a man hide himself in hiding places so I
do not see Him</u>**?” Declares the Lord. “**<u>Do I not fill the
heavens and the earth</u>**?” declares the Lord.

> Where is God? – near to us; He fills the heavens and the earth
>
> Can we hide from God? – no
>
> So, in God’s eyes, is there such a thing as secret sin? – No. He
> knows.

(next page)

**GOSPEL PRESENTATION** – if you are living with sin, secret sin – don’t
be fooled – God knows all about it. As we learned, sin is a barrier to
our fellowship with God – a temporary barrier for those of us who
believe, and an impregnable barrier for those who do not believe in
Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. The only way to overcome that
impregnable barrier and enter into fellowship with God and see Him work
all things together for good in your life is to confess your sins to God
and turn from them by repentance and accept Jesus Christ’s death on the
Cross by faith as an atoning sacrifice that paid the penalty for your
sins and submit your entire life to Him as Lord. If you do that, you
will be transferred from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of
God’s beloved son, you will have forgiveness, and you will have
fellowship with God, the Almighty Creator and Sustainer of the Universe.

###### Don’t Forget Quiz At End of Class

## Holiness

> torment in the Lake of Fire (Revelation 20:11-15)
>
> Do you know which judgment will be applied to you?
>
> Whichever one, it will be just because God is just.

## Wrath

> The wrath of God is a critical, but typically overlooked, attribute of
> God. If God’s wrath did not exist, we could say that He was
> indifferent to sin, and indifference to sin is inconsistent with God’s
> holiness and justice. We have already seen that God’s eyes are too

> class, and in our own lives.
>
> What is wrath? – anger, vengeance, punishment
>
> <u>Deuteronomy 32:39-41</u> – See now that I, I am He, and there is no
> god besides Me; it is I who put to death and give life. I have wounded
> and it is I who heal, and there is no one who can deliver from My
> hand. Indeed I lift up My hand to heaven, and say, as I live forever,
> if I sharpen My flashing sword, and My hand takes hold on justice,

> who hate Me</u>**.
>
> Who is speaking here? – God
>
> What does God say He will render on His adversaries? – vengeance
>
> What will God do to those who hate Him? – repay them

> deny His existence; those who ignore His Word; those who live in
> unrestrained sin; those who reject His Son.
>
> <u>Hebrews 12:28-29</u> – Therefore, since we receive a kingdom which
> cannot be shaken, let us show gratitude, by which we may offer to God
> an acceptable service with reverence and awe; for **<u>our God is a
> consuming fire</u>**

How does verse 29 describe God? – as a consuming fire

> Does this mean that every time we sin, we incur God’s wrath and will
> be punished? – it depends on our relationship with Jesus Christ
>
> God sees true believers as though they lived Christ’s life, and on the
> Cross, He saw Christ as if He had lived our lives. The Cross is a
> graphic depiction of how God views sin. If you have seen the Passion
> of Christ, you know what I am talking about.
>
> God’s wrath is serious, and unless you have a true, saving
> relationship with Jesus Christ, you will experience God’s wrath if not
> now, in eternity.

## Love

> Here are a few things that love is not: amiable weakness, good-natured
> indulgence, some sentimental feeling

<u>1 John 4:8, 16</u> – God is love.

> What is God? – love; love is His very nature
>
> <u>John 3:16</u> – For **<u>God so loved the world</u>** that He sent
> His only begotten Son that whoever believes in Him will not perish but
> have eternal life.
>
> How does God show His love for us? – He sent Jesus Christ to the Cross
> to die for our sins and purchase redemption for us
>
> Was this act of love influenced by anything in us? – No. God’s love is
> not influenced by us. In fact, … (next passage)

<u>Romans 5:8</u> – **<u>But God demonstrates His own love towards us,
in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us</u>**.

> What was our state when Christ died for us? – we were sinners
>
> Did we do anything to merit God’s love? – No.

Does God love everyone?

> In a sense – he sheds His common grace on everyone – allowing us to
> live despite our sin, providing food, clothes, shelter, family
>
> <u>Matthew 5:45b</u> – for He causes His sun to rise on the evil and
> the good, and send rain on the righteous and the unrighteous
>
> But, God’s love is sovereign. God chooses whom He gives His saving
> love, if you will.
>
> <u>Romans 9:13</u> – Jacob I have loved, but Esau I hated.
>
> God’s saving love is forever.
>
> <u>Jeremiah 31:3</u> – I have loved you with an **<u>everlasting
> love</u>**.

## Mercy

> <u>Psalm 103:17</u> – But **<u>the lovingkindness of the Lord</u>** is

> Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be
> born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ
> from the dead</u>**

Who is Peter praising here? – God the Father

What is Peter praising God for? – His mercy

What resulted from God’s mercy here? – we were born again

What were we born again to? – a living hope

What is that living hope based on? – Christ’s resurrection

> Why does Christ’s resurrection give us hope? – vindicates/approves
> Christ’s atoning work on the Cross for us; shows that Christ lives on;
> shows that those in Christ will be resurrected to eternal life
>
> What does knowing you have eternal life give you? – assurance,
> confidence in our beliefs

## Grace

> What is grace? – a free, unmerited gift
>
> <u>Exodus 33:19</u> – And He \[the Lord\] said, “I Myself will make
> all My goodness pass before you, and will proclaim the name of the
> Lord before you; and **<u>I will be gracious to whom I will be
> gracious</u>**, and will show compassion on whom I will show
> compassion.”

Who is speaking? – God

What does God say about His grace? – He will give it to whom he chooses

> In referring to His grace, what other attribute of God is on display?
> – sovereignty
>
> So, God, in His sovereignty, chooses whom He will be gracious to

<u>Ephesians 2:8-9</u> – For **<u>by grace you have been saved through
faith</u>**; and that not of yourselves, **<u>it is the gift of
God</u>**; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.

How is a person saved? – by grace through faith

What are we saved from? – God’s eternal wrath

Is there something we contribute to our salvation? – No – it is a gift
from God

What is a gift from God? – the grace and the faith

Do we contribute anything to our salvation, such as works? – No.
