FOF Lesson 7 – 2021

##### Introduction

Over the past number of weeks, we have looked at God the Father and His
attributes; we have looked at the person and work of Jesus Christ; we
have also looked doctrinally at salvation. This week, we will study the
Holy Spirit. This will not be an exhaustive study. For further reading,
I would recommend the book entitled “The Holy Spirit” by John Owen.
**<u>HANDOUTS</u>**.

##### The Holy Spirit is a Separate Person

<u>John 14:16-17</u> – I will ask the Father, and He will give you
another **<u>Helper</u>**, that **<u>He</u>** may be with you forever;
that is the **<u>Spirit of truth</u>**, **<u>whom the world cannot
receive, because it does not see Him or know Him</u>**, but you know Him
because **<u>He abides with you</u>** and will be **<u>in you</u>**.

Who will the Father give believers? – a Helper

What pronoun is used to refer to the Helper? – He; Him (not “it”)

What other name is given for the Helper? – the Spirit of truth

Who cannot receive the Helper? – the world

Why can’t the world receive Him? – they do not see Him or know Him (1
Cor. 2:14)

For believers, where is the Helper? – in them

Does He come and go? – No; He abides (dwells) in them; He is with them
forever

##### Deity of the Holy Spirit

The Holy Spirit is part of the Trinity and is God. He has the attributes
of God. In the interest of time, I will just highlight one Scripture
that shows the deity of the Holy Spirit. The handout has more on the
attributes of the Holy Spirit.

<u>Acts 5:1-4</u> – But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira,
sold a piece of property, and kept back some of the price for himself,
with his wife’s full knowledge, and bringing a portion of it, he laid it
at the apostles’ feet. But Peter said, “Ananias, **<u>why has Satan
filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit</u>** and to keep back some
of the price of the land? While it remained unsold, did it not remain
your own? And after it was sold, was it not under your control? Why is
it that you have conceived this deed in your heart? **<u>You have not
lied to men but to God</u>**.”

<u>Context</u> – in the early church, the believers shared everything
and looked after each other with great love and care. A couple named
Ananias and Sapphira were associated with the early believers, and they
sold some property to generate money to provide for the early church.
They kept some of the money from the sale for themselves, though.

What did Peter ask Ananias? – Why has Satan filled your heart to lie to
the Holy Spirit?

Who did Ananias lie to? – the Holy Spirit

In v. 4, who did Peter say Ananias lied to? – God

Who is the Holy Spirit then? – God

<u>Matthew 28:19</u> – Go therefore and make disciples of all the
nations, baptizing them in the name of **<u>the Father and the Son and
the Holy Spirit</u>**.

In whose name are we commanded to baptize? – Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit

God – singular; but three persons – all deserve same worship and
obedience

4.  **Possesses Attributes of People** – see handout for specific
    attributes (same as for God)

## Mind – <u>QUIZ QUESTION \# 1</u>

> <u>1 Corinthians 2:11</u> – For who among men knows the thoughts of a
> man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so **<u>the
> thoughts of God no one knows except the Spirit of God</u>**.
>
> Who knows the thoughts of God? – the Holy Spirit

What does that mean He has? – intellect; knowledge of God’s will

## Emotion

> <u>Ephesians 4:30</u> – **<u>Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of
> God</u>**, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
>
> What are believers commanded not to do? – grieve that Holy Spirit of
> God

What does it mean to grieve the Holy Spirit? – to cause the Spirit to
feel anguish

What does the Holy Spirit have if He can be grieved? – feelings,
emotions

What do believers do that grieves the Holy Spirit? – sin; not follow His
guidance

Do you grieve the Holy Spirit?

What is your response when you do?

### Will

> 1 Corinthians 12:7, 11 – to each one is given the **<u>manifestation
> of the spirit</u>** for the common good … **<u>one and the same
> Spirit</u>** works all these things, distributing to each one
> individually **<u>just as He wills</u>**.
>
> What does “manifestation of the Spirit” reference here (v. 1, 8-10)? –
> spiritual gifts
>
> Who receives spiritual gifts? – believers (v. 1 – “brethren”)
>
> Who decides which gift(s) each believer receives? – the Holy Spirit
> (“just as He wills”)

##### Work and Ministry of the Holy Spirit 

The Holy Spirit is active in a number of different ministries – see the
handout for details (READ OFF a few from chart). I am only going to
focus on a few aspects raised by the quiz answers.

### Testifies of Christ (QUIZ QUESTION \# 6)

> <u>John 15:26</u> – When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you
> from the Father, that is the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the
> Father, **<u>He will testify about Me</u>**
>
> What is the Spirit called here? – Helper; Spirit of truth
>
> Who will send Him? From whom does He come? – Jesus sends Him from the
> Father
>
> What will the Spirit do? – testify about Christ
>
> What does it mean that the Holy Spirit will testify about Christ? -
> OPEN

### Active in Salvation

The Holy Spirit is active in regeneration, conviction of sin, our
ability to acknowledge Christ as Lord; He indwells believers, He seals
believers, He teaches believers, and He is involved in our
sanctification. Again, you can look at the handout for additional
details.

1.  **Regeneration**

> <u>Titus 3:5</u> – He saved us, not on the basis of deeds which we
> have done in righteousness, but according to His mercy, by the
> **<u>washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit</u>**
>
> What are we saved according to? – God’s mercy
>
> How aren’t we saved? – deeds
>
> How is God’s mercy manifested to us in salvation? – by the washing of
> regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit
>
> What does washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit
> mean? – the Spirit cleanses our hearts (like water cleanses our
> bodies) and gives us new hearts and the desire to obey God

2.  **Conviction of Sin**

> <u>John 16:7-9</u> – But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage
> that **<u>I go away</u>**; for if I do not go away, the Helper will
> not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to you. And He,
> **<u>when He comes, will convict the world concerning sin</u>** and
> righteousness and judgment; **<u>concerning sin, because they do not
> believe in Me</u>**.
>
> What was the requirement for the Spirit to come? – Jesus going away
>
> What will the Spirit do when He comes? – convict of sin
>
> What does it mean to be convicted of sin? Is it just feeling bad about
> our sin? – No – it is our awareness that our personal sins have
> offended a holy God
>
> Do you realize that you are a sinner? Do you merely feel bad about the
> consequences of your sin OR do you see your personal sins as an
> offense against a holy God? Until you see your sins as an offense
> against a holy God and desire to turn from them, you will not be
> saved.

3.  **Acknowledgment of Christ as Lord**

> <u>1 Corinthians 12:3</u> – Therefore I make known to you that no one
> speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus is accursed”; and **<u>no
> one can say “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.</u>**
>
> What will no one speaking by the Spirit say? – Jesus is accursed
>
> What can no one say *except* by the Spirit? – Jesus is Lord
>
> Is confession of Christ as Lord necessary for salvation? – Yes (Romans
> 10:9)
>
> **<u>Who</u>** must we have to make such a confession? – the Holy
> Spirit
>
> Thinking back to the Ordo Salutis, when does the Spirit come to
> someone who will believe? – <u>Clue</u>: we just looked at this verse
> a few minutes ago – regeneration
>
> Can we earn the Spirit’s presence in our lives? – No
>
> How does it come? – by grace
>
> Who does it come from? – God

So, in relation to **<u>QUIZ QUESTION \# 10</u>**, do you see how the
Holy Spirit not only has something to do with a person before he or she
confesses Christ as Lord and Savior, but is intimately involved in
bringing that person to the point of confessing Christ as Lord and
Savior?

There is much more, and I encourage you all to review the supplemental
handout.

##### Baptism of the Holy Spirit

There is a lot of confusion today in the church, particularly in
charismatic churches about the difference between the baptism of the
Holy Spirit and the filling of the Holy Spirit. Charismatic churches
confuse the two and claim that believers need a second baptism of the
Holy Spirit to empower their ministry. What they are really talking
about is what is properly referred to as the “filling” of the Holy
Spirit, which is to be a <u>continual</u> process for believers, and is
<u>not</u> a second baptism, or spiritual “zap” that is an isolated,
singular event.

## Baptizes Believers into the Body of Christ

> <u>1 Corinthians 12:13</u> – For by one Spirit **<u>we were *all*
> baptized into one body</u>**, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves
> or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.
>
> What is the tense of “baptized”? – past tense
>
> What does “baptize” mean? – to dip, immerse, to be identified with or
> to come under the leadership of (<u>1 Cor. 10:2</u> – “and all were
> baptized into Moses”)
>
> Into whose body are believers baptized? – Christ’s
>
> How many believers have been baptized into the body of Christ? – all
>
> Who is it that baptizes us into the body of Christ? – the Holy Spirit
>
> Does this refer to baptism when a believer is immersed in water? – no,
> that is an act of obedience to Jesus’ command; this is a *spiritua*l
> baptism where a person who believes is placed into the body of Christ,
> under the Lordship of Christ, at the moment of salvation.

<u>Biblical Doctrine at 372</u> – “it is also clear from 1 Corinthians
12:13 that the filling with the Spirit is not the same as the baptism of
the Spirit because every believer has been baptized with and has
received the Spirit. Although its results are experienced and enjoyed,
baptism by and reception of the Spirit are not realities one can feel
and are certainly not experiences reserved only for specially-blessed
believers. Spirit baptism is a spiritual reality that occurs in every
believer the moment one becomes a Christian and is placed by Christ into
his body by the Holy Spirit, who then takes up residence in that life.
Filling can be interrupted by personal sin.”

## Happens Once – <u>QUIZ QUESTION \# 2</u>

> <u>Ephesians 4:4-6</u> – There is one body and one Spirit, just as
> also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith,
> **<u>one baptism</u>**, one God and Father of all who is over all and
> through all and in all.
>
> How many times does the baptism of the Holy Spirit occur? – once
>
> <u>The Baptism of the Holy Spirit – summary</u>:

1)  happens at the point of salvation

2)  involves receipt of the Holy Spirit as a seal and pledge – Eph.
    1:13-14

3)  places believers into the body of Christ

4)  happens only once

> We are <u>not</u> *commanded* to be indwellt by, sealed by, or
> baptized by the Spirit. We are, however, commanded to be filled with
> the Spirit.

7.  **Filling of the Holy Spirit (contrasted with the baptism of the
    Holy Spirit)**

## Definite Command

> <u>Ephesians 5:18</u> – And do not get drunk with wine, for that is
> dissipation, but **<u>be filled with the Spirit</u>**.
>
> What is the positive command of v. 18? – be filled with the Spirit
>
> What does it mean to “be filled” with the Spirit? – OPEN – controlled
> by; totally dominated by; permeated by (similar to being drunk with
> wine – alcohol permeates our bloodstream and goes throughout our
> bodies); carried along (like a twig on a stream). The Greek word for
> “be filled” is *pleroō* – it is like the wind in a sail.
>
> What it is not: (1) being indwellt by or receiving the Holy Spirit;
> (2) receiving the Holy Spirit in doses; (3) being baptized by the Holy
> Spirit (just discussed); (4) being sealed by the Holy Spirit; or, (5)
> receiving some temporary spiritual zap that results in ecstatic speech
> or visions.
>
> The verb tense in Greek is a present active imperative – it is a
> command for continuous action – like “be being kept continuously
> filled”. We are commanded to constantly be filled with the Spirit. It
> is not a one-time deal, but ongoing, moment-by-moment. So, **<u>QUIZ
> QUESTION \# 3</u>** – a believer is filled with the Holy Spirit more
> than once. It can come and go. It does not mean we lose the Spirit,
> but that we do not have the Spirit carrying us along at certain times.

## How are we to be Filled with the Spirit

> Want to compare these passages – just read them and compare:
>
> <u>Ephesians 5:18-22</u> – And do not get drunk with wine, for that is
> dissipation, but **<u>be filled with the Spirit</u>**, speaking to one
> another in **<u>psalms and hymns and spiritual songs</u>**, singing
> and making melody with your heart to the Lord; always giving thanks
> for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the
> Father; and be subject to one another in the fear of Christ. Wives, be
> subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord.
>
> <u>Colossians 3:16-18</u> – **<u>Let the word of Christ richly dwell
> within you</u>**, with all wisdom and teaching and admonishing one
> another with **<u>psalms and hymns and spiritual songs</u>**, singing
> with thankfulness in your hearts to God. Whatever you do whether in
> word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks
> through Him to God the Father. Wives, be subject to your husbands, as
> is fitting the Lord.
>
> Who wrote the letters of Ephesians and Colossians? – the apostle Paul
>
> We just noted that the positive command in Ephesians 5:18 is to be
> filled with the Spirit
>
> What is the command in Colossians 3:16? – let the word of Christ
> richly dwell within you
>
> What does dwell mean? – live, reside
>
> What does richly mean? - abundantly

In both passages, how are believers to speak to or teach one another? –
psalms and hymns and spiritual songs

> What else is common to both passages? – giving thanks to the Father
> through Christ
>
> What is the command to wives? – be subject to your husbands
>
> So, both passages start with apparently distinct commands that lead to
> the same results.

In light of that, how is a believer to be filled with the Spirit? – let
the word of Christ richly dwell within you.

> In other words, being filled with the Spirit is the same as being
> filled with the Word.
>
> So then, *what does it mean to be filled with the Word or to let the
> word of Christ richly dwell within us*? – to fill ourselves with the
> Word, so that our thoughts are the Word; so that our standards are the
> Word; the will of God as stated in the Word is our will; the view of
> God in the Word is our view of God – and don’t forget the word
> *pleroō.*

Are you filled with the Spirit? Is the Word of Christ richly dwelling
within you?

**<u>QUIZ QUESTION 8</u>** – We forfeit the filling of the Spirit when
we grieve the Holy Spirit (Eph. 4:30), quench the Holy Spirit (1 Thess.
5:19), get drunk (Eph. 5:18), lie to the Spirit (Acts 5:3,9), or walk in
the deeds of the flesh and not the Spirit (Gal. 5:16-23).

Remember, the command to be filled with the Spirit is a command for
continuous action – continue being filled by the Holy Spirit. It is
ongoing and continuous.

##### Application

Have you received the Holy Spirit?

Have you been baptized into Christ?

Are you now filled with the Spirit?

Are you walking in the flesh or the Spirit?

Does your life grieve the Holy Spirit?
