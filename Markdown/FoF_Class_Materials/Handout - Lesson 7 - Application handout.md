APPLICATION

<u>Galatians 5:16-25</u> – But I say, **<u>walk by the Spirit</u>**, and
you will not carry out the desire of the flesh. For the **<u>flesh</u>**
sets its desire against the **<u>Spirit</u>**, and the Spirit against
the flesh; for **<u>these are in opposition to one another</u>**, so
that you may not do the things that you please. But if you are led by
the Spirit, you are not under the Law. Now the deeds of the flesh are
evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery,
enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions,
factions, envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of
which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who
practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit
of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no
law. Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with
its passions and desires. If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by
the Spirit.
